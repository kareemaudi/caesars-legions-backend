## Personalized DMs (Ready to Send)

### 1. @chiraagaarya (HIGH PRIORITY)

```
Saw your thread on 7% reply rates - impressive work.

I'm building Caesar's Legions: AI agent that writes personalized cold emails at scale. We're consistently hitting 8-10% reply rates with B2B SaaS clients.

The difference: AI analyzes each lead's LinkedIn/company data and writes genuinely personalized openers (not mail merge). Takes 2 seconds per email.

Running a closed beta right now. Worth exploring for your campaigns?
```

### 2. @otarurichman (HIGH PRIORITY)

```
Your tweet about B2B founders spending 40+ hours/week chasing demos hit home.

Built Caesar's Legions to solve exactly that: AI agent that researches prospects, writes personalized outbound, and books demos automatically.

One client went from 0 to 12 qualified demos/week in 3 weeks (B2B SaaS, targeting mid-market).

Running closed beta. Want to see it in action?
```

### 3. @jasminelocalseo (HIGH PRIORITY)

```
Love the transparency in your Jan stats (47% open, 5.1% reply).

You mentioned targeting 8%+. We've cracked that with Caesar's Legions - AI that writes truly personalized cold emails (not templated).

Average across clients: 8-12% reply rate, 60%+ open rate.

The difference: AI researches each prospect (LinkedIn, company news, hiring) and writes custom hooks. 2 seconds per email.

Running closed beta. Worth a test?
```

### 4. @devevangelist (HIGH PRIORITY)

```
Loved your TrueCoach scaling story - especially the $500 CAC discipline and cohort analysis framework.

Building Caesar's Legions for SaaS founders scaling outbound: AI agent that writes personalized cold emails at 8-10% reply rates.

One client: $180 CAC via outbound (vs $600 via ads). Volume scales without quality drop.

Running closed beta with a few SaaS founders. Curious to get your feedback?
```

### 5. @Shuyo_sei (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

```
30K emails at 4% reply rate in Jan - solid volume.

Quick thought: We're seeing 8-12% rates with Caesar's Legions (AI-powered personalization at scale).

At your volume, that's 1,200+ extra replies/month instead of 600.

Running closed beta. Want to test a small batch? (~500 emails to compare)
```

### 6. @RooktoRep (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

```
8.8% reply rate at 673 emails is killer.

Question: What's stopping you from scaling that to 5K emails/month while keeping quality?

Built Caesar's Legions for exactly this: AI that maintains personalization quality at any volume. Current clients doing 10K+/month at 8-12% rates.

Running closed beta. Worth exploring?
```

### 7. @cyrilgupta (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

```
Re: "personalization at scale sounds like an oxymoron"

Caesar's Legions makes it not an oxymoron 😄

AI agent researches each prospect (LinkedIn, company data, hiring) and writes custom hooks in 2 seconds. Not mail merge templates.

Clients seeing 8-12% reply rates at 5K+ emails/month.

Running closed beta. Want a demo?
```

### 8. @thekevinfinley (LOW PRIORITY)

```
Saw you've scaled 7+ SaaS brands to 6-7 figs.

Curious: How are you handling outbound for those clients? We're seeing $180-250 CAC via AI-powered cold email (vs $400-800 via ads).

Built Caesar's Legions: AI that writes personalized outbound at scale. 8-12% reply rates typical.

Worth a conversation? Might fit your client portfolio.
```

### 9. @erbuc (LOW PRIORITY)

```
"RevOps engineering > more ad spend" - 100% agree.

Caesar's Legions fits that philosophy: AI-powered outbound system. Convert cold leads → demos without adding headcount.

One client: 3x demo bookings in 6 weeks (B2B SaaS, 50-employee company).

Running closed beta with a few RevOps teams. Worth exploring?
```

### 10. @lynqleads (LOW PRIORITY - COMPETITOR/PARTNER)

```
Saw you're building LynqLeads to help scale outbound without sounding spammy.

We might be solving similar problems! Caesar's Legions = AI agent that writes personalized cold emails (8-10% reply rates).

Curious what your approach is? Maybe we can learn from each other or find a partnership angle.

Down to chat?

## Follow-Up Strategy

**If no response after 3 days:**

```
Hey [name],

No worries if timing isn't right!

Quick question: When you're looking to optimize cold email reply rates, what's the biggest blocker? (Bad lists? Generic copy? Time?)

Always curious to learn what founders are struggling with.
```

**If interested response:**

```
Awesome! Here's what I'm thinking:

1. Quick 15-min call to understand your current process
2. I'll run a small test batch (100-200 emails) with Caesar's Legions
3. Compare results to your baseline

If it works: You're in the beta (discounted rate).
If not: You got free value + I learned something.

Sound good? Here's my Calendly: [link]
