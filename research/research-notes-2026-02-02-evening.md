- **Brave Search API:** Rate limited after 1 query (1 req/min on free tier)
- **Reddit/IH:** Discussions found but no direct Twitter handles visible
- **Solution:** Would need to manually browse these threads to find user profiles

## 🎯 Next Research Session Plan

**When:** Tomorrow (Tuesday) or when Brave API resets

**Focus:**
1. Search X for: "looking for cold email recommendations"
2. Find people replying to Instantly/Lemlist/Smartlead posts (warm audience)
3. Monitor Product Hunt launches (new SaaS founders)
4. Check Apollo for CTO/Founder titles at 10-50 person B2B companies

**Alternative (If Apollo still blocked):**
- Manual X search for "#saas #buildinpublic" posts from last 7 days
- Check who's posting revenue screenshots (indicates traction)
- Reply to relevant threads to build warm relationships

---

## 📈 Research Velocity

**Sessions Today:**
- Morning (11:45 AM): Found 6 prospects via X search
- Evening (6:33 PM): Validated pain points via Reddit/IH

**Quality > Quantity:**
- Rather than finding 50 lukewarm leads, focusing on 10 perfect fits
- @shainadenny alone worth more than 100 cold prospects

---

## 🔧 Process Improvements Needed

**If we had:**
- ✅ Apollo credits → Could auto-research 25 prospects every 6 hours
- ✅ Higher Brave API tier → Could scrape more sources faster
- ✅ Reddit API access → Could monitor r/SaaS in real-time
- ✅ IH scraper → Could catch "Looking for Feedback" posts immediately

**For now:** Manual research works fine at this scale (first 10 clients)

---

## 💰 Value of Current Pipeline

**If all 3 hot leads convert:**
- 3 clients × $250/mo = $750 MRR
- That's 7.5% toward $10K MRR goal
- And it gives us case studies to close next 10

**Conversion probability:**
- @shainadenny: 60% (explicitly looking, has budget)
- @Umargik: 40% (identified pain, building solutions)
- @ShaswatBuilds: 50% (has money, understands growth)

**Expected value:** ~1.5 clients = $375 MRR from current pipeline

## 🏆 Key Insight from Today's Research

**The Problem:** Most cold email tools are complicated.
- You need to learn Instantly + Apollo + Smartlead + GPT
- Set up warmup domains manually
- Figure out sequences yourself
- Interpret metrics

**Our Advantage:** We're a *service*, not a tool.
- $250/mo, everything included
- Client just gives us target audience
- We handle research, writing, sending, follow-ups
- Real-time dashboard shows results

**Position as:** "White-glove AI cold email service" (not another SaaS tool)
