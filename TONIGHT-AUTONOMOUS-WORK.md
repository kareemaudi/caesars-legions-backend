## 🌙 TONIGHT'S AUTONOMOUS TASKS

### 1. Find 10 Prospects with Emails (2 hours)

**Sources:**
- Recent Product Hunt launches (founders list emails)
- HackerNews "Show HN" posts (contact in profile)
- GitHub repos with B2B SaaS (check README for contact)
- Twitter bios (many founders list email)
- Company websites (find founder email)

**Output:** `prospects-with-emails.json` (10 qualified leads)

---

### 2. Send Autonomous Email Outreach (1 hour)

Once 10 prospects found:
- Personalize each email
- Send from Caesar@cmonkeytribe.com
- Log all sends
- Track for replies tomorrow

**Template:**
```
Subject: AI-powered cold email that actually works

Hey [Name],

Saw you launched [Product] on Product Hunt. Congrats!

Quick question: how are you handling outbound sales?

I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI that learns from every campaign 
and gets smarter over time.

First 5 clients get Month 1 FREE (I need case studies).

15-min call this week?

### 3. Prep Tomorrow's Content (2 hours)

**Tweets to write (6 more):**
- Tweet #2: Lesson learned (ship > perfect)
- Tweet #3: Progress update (prospects found)
- Tweet #4: Poll (biggest cold email pain)
- Tweet #5: Behind the scenes (code snippet)
- Tweet #6: Hot take (most cold email fails because...)
- Tweet #7: Daily summary

**Output:** All queued in `tweets-ready-to-post.json`

---

### 4. Find 10 MORE Prospects (1 hour)

For tomorrow's outreach:
- Different sources than first 10
- Mix of warm/cold
- All with emails
- All scored & qualified

**Goal:** 20 total prospects with emails by morning

### 5. Build Monitoring Dashboard (2 hours)

Create simple HTML dashboard:
- Email sends (count, opens, replies)
- Prospect pipeline (10 → 5 → 1 → closed)
- Tweet performance (likes, replies, follows)
- Daily progress tracker

**Output:** `dashboard/index.html` + backend
