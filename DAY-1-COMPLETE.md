## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked:
✅ **Act > plan** - Built systems, didn't just design  
✅ **Test immediately** - Sent test email, caught issues early  
✅ **Document as you go** - Everything logged in real-time  
✅ **Batch similar tasks** - Built all infrastructure together  

### What to Improve:
📌 Get Twitter API keys FIRST (before building script)  
📌 Find email prospects BEFORE building email system  
📌 Reddit DMs are manual - accept it, don't fight it  
📌 Browser automation is fragile - API > Puppeteer
