## 🚧 Blockers to First Client

### Critical Path Items:
1. **Authentication for outreach** (BLOCKER)
   - Need: Reddit account credentials OR
   - Need: X/Twitter authentication (bird cookies or Sweetistics)
   - Without this: Can't send DMs to prospects

2. **API Keys for service delivery** (BLOCKER)
   - OpenAI API key ($20 credit to start)
   - Apollo.io free tier account
   - Instantly.ai account ($37/mo)
   - Without these: Can't deliver service even if we get client

3. **Deployment** (BLOCKER after above)
   - Deploy backend to Railway
   - Test email sending
   - Set up monitoring

## 🔍 Prospect Sourcing Strategy (Remaining 6)

### High-Probability Sources:
1. **Indie Hackers** - Recent B2B tool launches (last 30 days)
2. **r/startups** - "Share Your Startup" weekly threads
3. **X/Twitter** - Search: "cold email", "outbound", "lead gen" + pain signals
4. **LinkedIn** - B2B SaaS founders posting about sales challenges
5. **Y Combinator** - Recent batch companies (public list)
6. **Product Hunt** - B2B tools launched this month

### Search Queries to Run:
- "struggling with outbound" site:twitter.com
- "cold email not working" site:reddit.com
- "how to get first customers B2B SaaS"
- "lead generation expensive"
- Recent YC batch + "looking for customers"

## 💡 Insights from Research

### Market Validation:
- **45% of B2B businesses** struggle with lead generation (Smartlead data)
- **Infrastructure cost:** $200-300/mo for proper setup (14 domains)
- **Performance benchmark:** 1-2% reply rate standard, 5%+ is excellent
- **Economic threshold:** Only works if LTV > $800

### What Founders Want:
1. **Infrastructure handled** - Don't want to manage domains/warmup
2. **Performance guarantee** - Pay for results, not effort
3. **Fast setup** - 2-3 days vs 3+ weeks warmup
4. **Inbox visibility** - Real deliverability data, not "sent" metrics
5. **AI personalization** - Beat 1-2% reply rates with better copy

### Caesar's Legions Differentiation:
- ✅ Managed infrastructure (vs DIY)
- ✅ Performance pricing (vs monthly retainer)
- ✅ AI personalization (vs templates)
- ✅ 48-hour setup (vs 3-week warmup)
- ✅ Deliverability transparency (vs black box)
