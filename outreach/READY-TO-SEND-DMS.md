## ✉️ DM Templates (Copy/Paste Ready)

### 1. @chiraagaarya (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Context:** Posted thread about 7% reply rate with cold email  
**URL:** https://x.com/chiraagaarya/status/2018326631446986905

**DM:**
```
Hey Chiraag!

Saw your thread on hitting 7% reply rates - congrats, that's solid work 🔥

Quick question: Have you tried AI personalization at scale? We're getting 8-12% consistently by having AI research each prospect and write custom emails (not just merge tags).

Built it for ourselves first, now offering to a few beta clients. Curious if you'd be open to running a test campaign (free, just for feedback)?

Would love to compare notes either way - always learning from folks who share their numbers openly 📊
```

**Why this works:** Acknowledges his success, offers value, low-pressure ask

### 2. @jasminelocalseo (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Context:** Shared Jan metrics: 5.1% reply rate, targeting 8%+  
**URL:** https://x.com/jasminelocalseo/status/2017975234188775556

**DM:**
```
Hi Jasmine,

Loved your transparent Jan report - 5.1% is above average for most! 

I saw you're targeting 8%+ this quarter. We consistently hit that with AI-powered personalization (each email researches the prospect + writes custom copy).

Would you be open to a test campaign? Free for the first 50 emails, just want feedback from someone who actually tracks metrics.

Either way, happy to share what we've learned getting from 4% → 9% over the past 6 months 📈
```

**Why this works:** Addresses her stated goal (8%+), offers test, positions you as experienced

---

### 3. @devevangelist (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Context:** TrueCoach founder (10K customers), discussed $500 CAC target  
**URL:** https://x.com/devevangelist/status/2001065587582419028

**DM:**
```
Hey Robbie,

Read your TrueCoach scaling story - the $500 CAC playbook is exactly what smart founders do (unit economics first!).

Curious: How are you handling outbound today? 

We built an AI system that researches prospects + writes personalized cold emails at scale. Getting 8-12% reply rates, CAC around $300-400 for SaaS deals.

If you're ever looking to add another acquisition channel to the mix, happy to run a free test campaign for TrueCoach. Would love to learn from a founder who's scaled to 10K customers 🚀
```

**Why this works:** Respects his success, business-focused, soft pitch

---

### 4. @otarurichman (WARM)

**Context:** B2B AI SaaS founder, tweets about needing automation  
**URL:** https://x.com/otarurichman/status/2000818171465404613

**DM:**
```
Hey Otaru!

Your tweet about B2B founders spending 40h/week chasing demos hit home.

We built an AI system that automates exactly that - researches prospects, writes personalized cold emails, handles follow-ups, delivers qualified replies to your inbox.

Getting 8-12% reply rates consistently. Would you be open to a free test? 50 emails to your ideal customer profile, just want feedback from another B2B SaaS founder.

Either way, curious how you're solving this for your product - always learning 🧠
```

**Why this works:** Addresses his exact pain point, positions as peer, not salesy

---

### 5. @Shuyo_sei (WARM)

**Context:** High volume (30K emails/month), 4% reply rate  
**URL:** https://x.com/Shuyo_sei/status/2017470537023557961

**DM:**
```
Hey Shafez,

30K emails at 4% is solid execution 💪

Quick question: What if you could double that to 8%? Same volume, 2x the leads.

We're using AI to personalize at scale (research each prospect → custom email). Consistently hitting 8-12% reply rates.

Would you be open to a comparison test? Run 100 emails through our system vs your current setup, compare results?

Either way, respect the volume you're pushing - that's not easy to maintain 🏆
```

**Why this works:** Challenges him to improve, offers competitive test, respects current success

---

### 6. @RooktoRep (WARM)

**Context:** 8.8% reply rate at low volume  
**URL:** https://x.com/RooktoRep/status/2017324993969840478

**DM:**
```
Hey Rook,

8.8% reply rate is killer 🔥 Most people struggle to hit 5%.

Noticed your volume is on the lower side - curious, what's limiting scale? Time? Infrastructure? Quality concerns?

We built an AI system that maintains personalization quality while scaling volume. If you're interested, happy to help you 10x volume while keeping that 8%+ reply rate.

Free test if you want to see it in action. Either way, would love to know your secret to 8.8% - always learning!
```

**Why this works:** Flatters his results, identifies pain (scale), offers solution

---

### 7. @cyrilgupta (WARM)

**Context:** Focused on personalization at scale  
**URL:** https://x.com/cyrilgupta/status/2017121125793186039

**DM:**
```
Hey Cyril,

Re: your tweet about personalization at scale sounding like an oxymoron - I thought so too until 6 months ago!

AI changed the game. We have it research each prospect (LinkedIn, Twitter, company news) and write fully custom emails. No templates. 8-12% reply rates consistently.

Would you be open to seeing it in action? Free test campaign, just curious if someone who thinks deeply about personalization would see value.

Either way, happy to share what we've learned - it's a fascinating problem 🧠
```

**Why this works:** Directly addresses his skepticism, offers proof, intellectual appeal

## 🎯 Execution Plan

### Week 1: First 3 Prospects (Feb 3-5)

**Monday Evening (Tonight):**
- Send DMs to @chiraagaarya, @jasminelocalseo, @devevangelist
- Set calendar reminder for 24h follow-up check

**Tuesday Morning:**
- Check for responses
- If response: Book demo call (use Calendly or manual)
- If no response: Wait another 24h (don't double-DM)

**Wednesday:**
- Check responses again
- If 0/3 responded: Send next batch (Tier 2)
- If 1+ responded: Focus on demo prep

**Thursday-Friday:**
- Run test campaigns for anyone who said yes
- Document results
- Ask for testimonial if successful

### Week 2: Scale Up (Feb 6-12)

**If Week 1 converts 1+ client:**
- Focus 100% on delivering results
- Use results to approach Tier 2 with proof

**If Week 1 gets 0 clients:**
- Send all Tier 2 (4 more DMs)
- Improve messaging based on rejections
- Consider offering even lower friction (free 100 emails, no ask)

## 📋 Pre-Send Checklist

Before sending DMs, verify:

- [ ] @agenticCaesar profile looks professional

## 🧪 A/B Test Ideas (If First Batch Fails)

**Alternative Approach #1: Offer Free Tool**
```
"Built a free tool that scores your cold email copy (AI-powered). 

Want to try it on one of yours? Just paste and I'll run the analysis."
```
→ Gets them engaged, builds trust, shows expertise

**Alternative Approach #2: Content-First**
```
"Writing a guide on cold email reply rates (comparing 50+ campaigns).

Mind if I ask: What's your current benchmark? Trying to gather real data."
```
→ Flattery (asking their opinion), builds relationship, soft pitch later

**Alternative Approach #3: Ultra-Direct**
```
"Do you spend more than $500/mo on cold email tools?

We're doing the same thing for $99/mo using AI. Curious if you'd want to compare."
```
→ Price-first positioning, clear value prop, binary decision

---

## 📊 Expected Results (Realistic)

**Optimistic:**
- 3 DMs sent → 2 responses → 1 demo → 1 client
- Timeline: 3-5 days
- Revenue: $99-500 (depending on pricing)

**Realistic:**
- 10 DMs sent → 4 responses → 2 demos → 1 client
- Timeline: 7-10 days
- Revenue: $99-500

**Pessimistic:**
- 10 DMs sent → 2 responses → 1 demo → 0 clients
- Timeline: 7-14 days
- Revenue: $0 (but lessons learned)

**Even if pessimistic:** You'll learn what messaging works/doesn't, build relationships, get feedback on the product.

- Avoid weekends (lower engagement)
- Give 48h before assuming "no" (people are busy)

**Tone:**
- Keep it casual, not salesy
- Peer-to-peer, not vendor-to-customer
- Ask questions, don't just pitch
- Show genuine interest in their business

**Follow-up:**
- If no response in 3 days: Send follow-up ("Hey, just bumping this - curious if you saw it?")
- If response but no commitment: "No pressure either way - happy to answer questions or just leave the offer open"
