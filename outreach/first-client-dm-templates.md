**Perfect first client:**
- B2B SaaS founder/marketer
- 500-5,000 followers (established but not huge)
- Posts about growth, sales, or lead gen
- Mentions struggles with cold email OR outbound
- Active engagement (replies to others)
- Revenue signal: $5K-50K MRR range

**Red flags (skip):**

- Influencers (too busy)
- Agency owners (will want free trial forever)
- People who never reply to DMs

## 📝 Template 1: Problem-First Approach

**When to use:** They recently tweeted about cold email struggles

```
Hey [First Name] 👋

Saw your tweet about [specific problem]. I'm building something that might help.

We use AI agents to:
- Write personalized cold emails (not templates)
- Auto-follow up 3-5x
- Track replies + sentiment

Running a pilot with 2-3 early users this week. Would you be interested in testing it (free for first campaign)?

Happy to show you what we're building 🛠️
```

**Why it works:**
- References their actual tweet (not spam)
- Solves specific pain point they mentioned
- Low commitment ("testing")
- Free for first campaign removes friction

---

## 📝 Template 2: Results-First Approach

**When to use:** They post about growth, metrics, revenue

```
[First Name] - quick question 🤔

If I could get you 5-10 qualified leads for your SaaS this week (people who actually reply), would you take 15 min to try our system?

We're launching Caesar's Legions (AI-powered cold email) and need 3 pilot users. Free first campaign, you keep all the leads.

You in?
```

**Why it works:**
- Clear value prop (5-10 leads)
- Short time commitment (15 min)
- Reciprocity (free campaign)
- Direct CTA (You in?)

---

## 📝 Template 3: Social Proof Approach

**When to use:** After we have our first success story

```
Hey [First Name]!

We just helped [Company] book 3 demos from one cold email campaign (47 emails sent).

Building Caesar's Legions - AI agents that write personalized cold emails + auto-follow up. Looking for 2 more pilot users.

Want to see the actual emails we sent? I can show you what worked.
```

**Why it works:**
- Concrete results (3 demos, 47 emails)
- Name-drop successful client
- Shows actual work (transparency)
- Consultative ("I can show you")

---

## 📝 Template 4: AI Agent Hook

**When to use:** They tweet about AI, automation, or agents

```
[First Name] - saw you're into AI agents 🤖

Built something wild: AI that writes cold emails, learns from replies, auto-follows up, and gets better over time.

It's like having a sales SDR that never sleeps and costs $100/mo.

Running pilot campaigns this week. Want in?
```

**Why it works:**
- Aligns with their interest (AI)
- Cool factor ("wild")
- Clear pricing anchor ($100/mo)
- FOMO (pilot this week)

---

## 📝 Template 5: Founder-to-Founder

**When to use:** They seem approachable, talk about building in public

```
Hey [First Name] 👋

Fellow builder here. Launching Caesar's Legions (AI cold email agents) this week.

Day 3 of $0 → $10K MRR challenge. Looking for 1-2 early users who'll give honest feedback.

Would you try it? Free first campaign, and if it sucks I'll tell you why before you pay anything.
```

**Why it works:**
- Peer relationship (fellow builder)
- Transparency (Day 3, building in public)
- Risk reversal (I'll tell you if it sucks)
- Honest tone (not salesy)

---

## 🎯 Advanced: The Research DM

**When to use:** High-value target, worth extra effort

**Before sending:**
1. Read their last 20 tweets
2. Check their website/product
3. Find 1 specific thing to compliment
4. Identify their biggest pain point

```
[First Name] - love what you're building with [Product] 🔥

Noticed you're at [specific milestone/challenge]. We're launching Caesar's Legions (AI cold email) and I think it could help you [specific outcome].

Built it specifically for founders like you who need outbound but don't have time to write 100 personalized emails.

Can I show you a quick demo? Takes 5 min, and if it's not relevant I'll tell you immediately.
```

**Why it works:**
- Personalized (shows you did research)
- Relevant (ties to their situation)
- Specific outcome (not vague)
- Respects their time (5 min)
- Authority (I'll tell you if it's not relevant)

---

## ⚡ Follow-Up Sequence (If No Reply)

### Day 3 Follow-Up

```
[First Name] - following up on my DM about Caesar's Legions.

I get it, you're busy. Here's the TL;DR:

→ Free first campaign (we write 50 cold emails for you)
→ AI personalization (not templates)
→ Takes 15 min to set up

Worth a shot?
```

### Day 7 Follow-Up (Last One)

```
Last ping [First Name] 👋

We're closing pilot spots tomorrow. If you're interested in testing Caesar's Legions (free first campaign), let me know today.

Either way - good luck with [their project]! 🚀
```

**Why it works:**
- Shows persistence (not annoying)
- Creates urgency (closing tomorrow)
- Polite exit (good luck with their project)

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

**Avoid:**

- ❌ Asking for anything before giving value
- ❌ Long paragraphs (keep it under 5 lines)
- ❌ Multiple questions in one DM
- ❌ Following up more than 2x
- ❌ Pitching features (pitch outcomes)
- ❌ "Can I pick your brain?" (waste of their time)
- ❌ Being salesy (be human)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Send DMs when they're active** - Check when they usually tweet, DM 30 min later
2. **Reference recent activity** - "Loved your thread about X yesterday"
3. **Use their language** - If they say "pipeline," you say "pipeline" (not "funnel")
4. **Show, don't tell** - "Here's an email we wrote for [Client]" > "We write great emails"
5. **Make it easy to say yes** - One-click calendar link > "When are you free?"

---

## 📅 Daily Workflow

**Every morning (10 min):**
1. Find 10 new targets on X
2. Research each (2 min per person)
3. Send 5 DMs (using templates above)
4. Follow up with 3 people from previous days

**Track everything.**
