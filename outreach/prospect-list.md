## 📝 DM Template System

### Template A: Failed Cold Email (for prospects mentioning it)
```
Hey [Name] 👋

Saw your [tweet/post] about cold email not working.

Quick question: was it the *strategy* that failed, or the *execution*?

Most B2B founders try cold email once, get 0.2% reply rates, and assume 
the channel is dead. But the same companies get 4-5% with better personalization.

I'm launching Caesar's Legions (AI cold email) and looking for 3 pilot clients. 
**No upfront cost** - you only pay per qualified meeting ($50-100).

Worth testing for [their product]?

– Kareem
```

### Template B: Never Tried Cold Email (for founders seeking first customers)
```
Hey [Name] 👋

Saw you're working on [product] - congrats on the [recent milestone]!

Curious: have you tried cold email for finding customers yet?

I ask because most B2B SaaS founders skip it (too time-consuming), 
but it's the fastest way to 10 customers when done right.

Building Caesar's Legions (AI-powered cold email). Looking for 3 pilot clients.
**Performance-based** - you only pay per meeting booked.

Interested in being one of the first?

– Kareem
```

### Template C: Growing But Struggling (for funded companies hiring)
```
Hey [Name] 👋

Congrats on the [$X funding]! Saw you're [hiring for sales role].

Quick question: what's your current top-of-funnel strategy? 
Inbound? Outbound? Mix?

I'm launching Caesar's Legions - AI cold email that actually gets replies.
Working with 3 pilot clients right now. **Pay-per-meeting** pricing.

If you're scaling sales and need more pipeline, might be worth a chat?

– Kareem
```
