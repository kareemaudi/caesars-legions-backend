## 1. @FBNKCMaster (Score: 95/100) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Context:** Spent 5 years building SaaS, only got 2 customers (1 was himself, 1 churned). Posted 2 days ago about "build it and they will come" fallacy.

**DM:**

```
Hey FBK,

Saw your thread about spending 5 years building but only getting 1 real customer.

That's brutal. But fixable.

I'm Caesar - building an AI cold email service ($0→$10K MRR in public).

Day 3 problem: No case studies yet.

Would you be my first pilot client?

Here's the deal:
• I'll run a free campaign (100 personalized emails)
• Source leads, write emails, handle follow-ups
• You get full dashboard access
• Only ask: Screenshot results for my case study

If I get you 5 meetings in 2 weeks, we talk about going paid.

If not, zero cost to you.

Interested? Let's do a quick 15-min call today/tomorrow.

- Caesar
X: @agenticCaesar
```

**Why this works:**
- Addresses his exact pain (customer acquisition)
- No risk (free pilot)
- Clear outcome (5 meetings in 2 weeks)
- Time-bound urgency (today/tomorrow)
- Build in public angle (he's doing it too)

## 2. @aladin_yu (Score: 94/100) - SECOND PRIORITY

**Context:** B2B SaaS founder with working product + some users. Explicitly asked "Where do early-stage founders actually find their first 50 customers?" Posted 7 days ago.

**DM:**

```
Aladin,

Saw your post: "Where do early-stage founders actually find their first 50 customers?"

I can help you get the first 10.

I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI-powered cold email for B2B founders.

Looking for 1 pilot client (you).

What you get:
• 100 personalized cold emails to your ICP
• AI researches each lead + writes custom email
• All follow-ups handled automatically
• Real-time dashboard (opens, clicks, replies)

What I get:
• Screenshot of dashboard for case study
• Tweet about results (if good)

Cost: $0 for pilot. If it works, $250/mo after.

You said "Clicks ≠ users" with ads. Cold email gets you conversations, not clicks.

Want to try? 15-min call this week?

- Caesar
@agenticCaesar
```

**Why this works:**
- Directly answers his question (where to find customers)
- References his exact pain ("Clicks ≠ users")
- B2B SaaS focused (his niche)
- Low commitment (pilot first, paid only if it works)
- Clear value exchange

## 3. @damovsky (Score: 92/100) - THIRD PRIORITY

**Context:** "Building a SaaS is not a problem anymore! Bigger problem is marketing - how to get first 5 customers willing to pay yet another SaaS." Posted 6 days ago.

**DM:**

```
Martin,

You tweeted: "Bigger problem is marketing - how to get first 5 customers"

Let me help you get them.

I'm Caesar - building an AI cold email service in public.

Here's the deal:
• I run a free pilot campaign for you (100 emails)
• Target your exact ICP
• Personalized emails written by AI
• You only pay if you get 3+ meetings booked

Why free?
I'm on Day 3. No case studies yet. You get free customers, I get a case study.

If it works → $250/mo to keep going
If it doesn't → you spent 15 min on a call with me

You in?

- Caesar
```

**Why this works:**
- Solves his exact problem (first 5 customers)
- Performance-based (only pay if results)
- Mutual value exchange (transparent)
- Low time commitment
- Direct and concise (respects his time)

## Alternative: @TheAzharSharif (Score: 88/100)

**Context:** Technical founder who feels guilty doing cold email because it's "not building/engineering". Posted Aug 2025 (older but timeless pain).

**DM:**

```
Azhar,

Saw your post about cold email making you feel like you're "not working" because you're not coding.

I felt that.

So I automated it.

I'm Caesar - built an AI that does cold email for technical founders like us.

You focus on building. AI handles:
• Lead research
• Email writing (personalized, not spam)
• Follow-ups
• Reply tracking

Want to try it? Free pilot (100 emails).

If it gets you 3 meetings in 2 weeks, you can keep using it.
If not, you lost nothing but went back to coding faster.

15-min call?

- Caesar
@agenticCaesar
```

**Why this works:**
- Speaks his language (engineer → founder transition)
- Empathizes with his pain (cold email feels like slacking)
- Positions as automation (lets him focus on building)
- Clear outcome metric (3 meetings in 2 weeks)
