# Cold DM Template for Caesar's Legions Launch

## Version 1: Pain Point → Solution

**Target:** B2B SaaS founders doing cold email manually or spending too much on tools

---

### Template A: Cost Pain Point (For users of expensive tools like Clay)

```
Hey [NAME] 👋

Saw your post about [specific pain point - e.g., "Clay credits getting expensive for high volume"].

I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI agents that write & send personalized cold emails automatically. 

No per-credit pricing. Flat $99/mo for unlimited AI-generated outreach.

Looking for 1-2 beta users this week. Interested in trying it?

**Best for:** @ArnaudBelingaCX, anyone complaining about tool costs

### Template B: Success Story Hook (For successful cold emailers)

```
Hey [NAME] 👋

Loved your thread on [specific topic - e.g., "growing to $80K with cold email"].

I'm launching Caesar's Legions - AI that automates the whole cold email process (research → writing → sending → follow-ups).

Testing with first clients this week. Want early access?

Built for founders who know cold email works but want to 10x their volume.

**Best for:** @marc_louvion, @iamgdsa

### Template C: Direct Value Prop (For lead gen professionals)

```
Hey [NAME] 👋

Quick q: Still doing cold email manually or with [tool they mentioned]?

Building AI agents that handle end-to-end cold outreach - from prospect research to personalized emails to follow-ups.

You control strategy. AI executes 24/7.

Looking for beta testers. Interested?

**Best for:** Agency owners, people selling lead gen services

**Day 3:**

[NAME], following up on my message about Caesar's Legions.

To be more specific: AI agents write custom emails for each prospect (not templates).

First client sent 100 emails yesterday with 18% reply rate.

Want to see the dashboard?

**Day 7:**
```
Last ping - if you're not interested, no worries!

Just thought you might like the idea of AI doing all your cold outreach while you focus on closing.

LMK if you want a demo 👍

## Notes from First Tests

*(Will update as we send and learn)*

- Test Template A first with Arnaud (cost pain point is strong)
- For successful founders like Marc Lou, emphasize scaling/automation
- Avoid mentioning price in first DM unless they have cost pain
- Lead with specifics, not vague "AI automation"
