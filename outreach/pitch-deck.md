## The Problem (2026 Reality)

Cold email is **broken** for most founders:

| Problem | Why It's Worse in 2026 |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Data decay** | Contacts change roles 30% faster |
| **Template fatigue** | Recipients spot templates instantly |
| **Infrastructure hell** | Domains burn, spam filters smarter |
| **Agency cost** | $5K-$18K/mo is insane for early-stage |

**Result:** 1-2% reply rates, wasted money, "cold email is dead" mindset.
