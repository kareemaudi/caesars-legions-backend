## 🔥 PRIORITY 1: @shainadenny (Score: 95)

**Context:**  
Posted Nov 19, 2025 asking for cold email/call help for 60-day campaign. Has 20K lead list. Willing to pay per appt or 60% commission.

**Strategy:**  
Reply to her original tweet OR DM directly. Position as better than individual/agency because AI scales without human limitations.

**Tweet to Reply:**

### DM Option A: Direct Reply to Tweet

```
Hey Shaina - saw your post about needing cold outbound help.

Quick question: Did you find someone or still testing?

I built an AI system that might be better than hiring an individual or agency:

• Handles your 20K lead list systematically
• 100+ personalized emails/week
• Automated follow-ups (3-day, 7-day sequences)
• Real-time dashboard showing every open/click/reply
• $250/mo (way cheaper than 60% commission)

Built for B2B outbound, currently in beta with 3 test clients.

Worth a quick call to show you the dashboard?

### DM Option B: Direct Approach (If tweet conversation is old)

```
Shaina,

Saw you were looking for cold outbound help for your pet franchise business back in November.

Not sure if you found someone, but I built an AI cold email system that's different:

Instead of hiring a person ($3-5K/mo) or agency ($2-10K/mo), my AI handles:
• 100 personalized emails/week from your 20K list
• Automated follow-ups
• Real-time tracking dashboard
• $250/mo, cancel anytime

Currently testing with 3 beta clients. If you're still looking or your current setup isn't working, happy to show you a quick demo.

No pressure either way - just thought of your tweet when I launched.

**Next Action:** Send TODAY (Monday morning perfect timing)

## 🔥 PRIORITY 2: @Umargik (Score: 85)

**Context:**  
Muhammad Umar, building CodeNinjaInc (internal tools company across Riyadh/Seattle/SF). Posted Oct 2025: "Outbound sales is broken. We need to fix this."

**Strategy:**  
Reference his exact tweet. Position as solution to the problem he identified. Technical founder, so emphasize AI/automation sophistication.

**Tweet to Reference:**  
https://x.com/Umargik/status/1983149437397676050

### DM Draft

```
Muhammad,

Saw your tweet from October about outbound sales being broken.

Couldn't agree more - which is why I built Caesar's Legions.

It's an AI agent system for B2B cold email that fixes what's broken:
• No generic templates (GPT-4 researches each prospect)
• No spray-and-pray (Apollo.io sourcing for quality)
• No black box (real-time dashboard shows everything)
• Actually works (automated follow-ups, tracking, sentiment analysis)

Since you're building internal tools at CodeNinjaInc, I'd love your feedback on the architecture. I'm documenting everything publicly.

$250/mo beta pricing for the first 10 companies. 

Worth a 15-min call? I can show you under the hood.

P.S. If you're already solving this internally, no worries - always happy to compare notes with fellow builders.
```

**Next Action:** Send TODAY or Tuesday morning (give him time since he's multi-timezone)

## 🟡 WARM LEADS (Follow First, Engage, Then DM)

### @motyar - ZenMic (Score: 75)

**Action Plan:**
1. Follow @motyar
2. Like/comment on his next MRR update
3. After 2-3 interactions, send DM

**Future DM Template:**
```
Hey Motyar,

Love following your ZenMic journey. 

Quick question: How are you getting customers right now? 

I'm building an AI cold email service (Caesar's Legions) and looking for beta clients who build in public.

$250/mo for 100 personalized emails/week. You'd get:
• Day 1 pricing (locked forever)
• I document your results publicly (free marketing for ZenMic)
• Cancel anytime if it's not working

Worth a quick call?
```

### @ShaswatBuilds - ₹2L+ MRR (Score: 80)

**Action Plan:**
1. Follow @ShaswatBuilds
2. Reply to his next post about startup journey/failures
3. Build rapport over 1 week
4. Then DM

**Future DM Template:**
```
Shaswat,

Your story about 3 failed attempts → ₹2L MRR is inspiring.

I'm guessing scaling past ₹2L is the next challenge?

Built an AI cold email system specifically for B2B SaaS founders who need sales velocity without hiring a team.

$250/mo (₹21K), 100 personalized emails/week, automated follow-ups.

Beta pricing - first 10 clients lock it in forever.

If outbound is on your roadmap, happy to show you how it works.

- Kareem
