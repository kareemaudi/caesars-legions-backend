| Data quality issues | Template A | r/coldemail prospects |
| Copy quality struggles | Template B | r/SaaS founders |
| Infrastructure complexity | Template C | Technical founders |
| "Cold email is dead" mindset | Template D | Skeptics/churned users |
| Looking for recommendations | Template E | Active shoppers |

## Template A: Data Quality Pain

**Use when:** Prospect complained about stale lists, bounces, role changes

```
Hey {name},

Saw your post about data quality killing your campaigns - we're solving that exact problem.

Quick context: We built an AI cold email service that pulls fresh data from Apollo in real-time (no more stale lists) + AI personalizes every email so it doesn't sound templated.

We're doing free test campaigns (50 emails) for founders who've struggled with this. Interested?

Not a fit? No worries - happy to share what's working for us in 2026.
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges specific pain they mentioned
- Explains how we solve it (Apollo integration)
- Low-risk offer (free test)
- No pressure close

---

## Template B: Copy Quality Pain

**Use when:** Prospect said copy is their bottleneck, templates aren't working

```
Hey {name},

Read your comment about copy being the hardest part of cold email - even with good targeting.

We built something that might help: AI that analyzes your target's LinkedIn/website and writes personalized emails. Not templated "Hey {firstName}" stuff - actually relevant intros.

Running free test campaigns for founders (50 emails). Want me to show you what AI-generated copy looks like for your ICP?
```

**Why it works:**
- Directly addresses their stated pain
- Differentiates from generic personalization
- Curiosity hook ("show you what it looks like")

---

## Template C: Infrastructure Pain

**Use when:** Prospect mentioned domain burning, deliverability issues, setup complexity

```
Hey {name},

Saw you're dealing with the infrastructure side of cold email (domains, deliverability, etc). It's gotten brutal in 2026.

We run a done-for-you cold email service where we handle all the infrastructure - domains, warming, rotation, deliverability. You just approve the emails.

If you're burning through $500+/mo on tools + hours on setup, we might save you both. Interested in a test run?
```

**Why it works:**
- Validates the complexity they're experiencing
- Positions as "done-for-you" solution
- Compares cost (tool stacking is expensive)

---

## Template D: Skeptic/Churned User

**Use when:** Prospect said "cold email is dead" or has given up

```
Hey {name},

Noticed your post about cold email not working. Honestly, the way most people do it - it IS basically dead.

But we're seeing 8-12% reply rates with a different approach: AI-written emails + fresh Apollo data + managed infrastructure. No templates, no spray-and-pray.

You probably don't want another cold email pitch (ironic, I know). But if you're curious what's actually working in 2026, happy to share - no pitch attached.
```

**Why it works:**
- Agrees with their skepticism (builds rapport)
- Differentiates our approach
- Offers value without pushing sale
- Self-aware about the irony

---

## Template E: Active Shopper

**Use when:** Prospect is actively asking for recommendations or comparing tools

```
Hey {name},

Saw you're evaluating cold email tools/services. Quick pitch:

We're Caesar's Legions - AI-powered cold email done-for-you.

vs Instantly/Lemlist: We write the emails (AI) + provide data (Apollo) + handle infrastructure. Not just sending.

vs Agencies ($5K-$18K/mo): We're $250/mo for 1K emails. AI lets us charge 95% less.

If you want, I can run a free 50-email test so you can see results before committing. LMK.
```

**Why it works:**
- Direct, no fluff
- Clear positioning vs alternatives
- Concrete pricing (differentiator)
- Free trial offer

---

## 📧 Follow-Up DM (No Response After 48h)

```
Hey {name},

Following up on my message about AI cold email. 

I get it if the timing's off or it's not a priority right now. 

But if you're still dealing with {their_pain_point}, the free test offer stands.

Either way, good luck with {their_project_if_known}!
```

## 📊 Tracking Template

When Kareem starts outreach, track:

```
| Date | Prospect | Platform | Template | Response? | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 2/3  | @user1   | X DM     | A        | ...       | ...   |
```

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. **Don't pitch in public threads** - looks desperate
2. **Don't send identical messages** - X flags bulk DMs
3. **Don't mention competitors by name** - comes off salty
4. **Don't push hard close** - let them opt in
5. **Don't lie about results** - build trust > quick sale

---

## ✅ Next Steps for Kareem

1. [ ] Authenticate bird CLI (login to X in Chrome, close browser, retry)
2. [ ] Find X handles for Reddit users (search "{reddit_username} twitter" or check Reddit profiles)
3. [ ] Start with Template D/E (lowest friction, proves concept)
4. [ ] Track responses in `research/outreach-log.jsonl`
5. [ ] First goal: 10 DMs → 2-3 conversations → 1 free trial → 1 paid client
