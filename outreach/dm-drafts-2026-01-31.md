# DM Drafts - Caesar's Legions Outreach
**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Goal:** First paying client by Day 3  
**Target:** 10 DMs sent, 3 replies, 1 pilot client

---

## Prospect #1: @SubhaghV (Subhaghvs) - P1 PRIORITY

**Context:** Teaches cold email infrastructure to SaaS founders. Recent tweet about 50K emails/month volume requirements.

**Approach:** Partnership angle + customer angle (he likely does cold email himself)

**DM:**
```
Hey Subhagh,

Saw your thread about needing 50K emails/month for proper testing. You're 100% right—volume is the only way to get statistical significance.

Quick question: when you're helping clients set up that 3-5 domain infrastructure, what's the biggest bottleneck? Warmup time? Deliverability management? Or just the operational overhead?

I'm launching Caesar's Legions (AI-powered cold email service). We handle the entire infrastructure + use GPT-4 to personalize every email. Targeting 4-5% reply rates vs the 1-2% industry average.

Two paths I see:
1. Partnership: We handle infrastructure for your clients, you focus on strategy
2. Customer: We run cold email for your own business (if you do outbound)

Either way, worth a quick call to see if there's a fit?

**Expected Response:** "Tell me more about the partnership model" OR "What's your pricing?"

## Prospect #2: @otarurichman (Otaru Richman) - P2 PRIORITY

**Context:** Multiple tweets about B2B SaaS multi-channel systems, attribution, cold email as part of broader strategy.

**Approach:** Solve attribution + infrastructure pain

**DM:**
```
Otaru,

Your point about tracking attribution across channels hit home. Most B2B SaaS founders have no idea which cold email landed the $80K deal.

Caesar's Legions is built to solve this. We don't just send emails—we track:
• Which subject line led to demo booking
• Which personalization angle converted
• Email → Demo → Close attribution

Plus we handle all infrastructure (domains, warmup, deliverability) so you're not managing 14 domains manually.

Currently onboarding 3 pilot clients ($500K-$5M ARR B2B SaaS). Performance-based pricing: pay per meeting booked, not per email sent.

Interested in testing 500 emails this week? Zero risk—if we don't book meetings, you don't pay.

– Kareem

```

**Expected Response:** "What industries have you worked with?" OR "What's the meeting rate you're seeing?"

## Prospect #3: @Adamweill1 (Adam Weill) - P2 PRIORITY

**Context:** Advises SaaS founders to prioritize outbound early. "Cold email + LinkedIn DMs create feedback loops."

**Approach:** Tool for his clients OR his own business

**DM:**
```
Adam,

"Outbound beats content at the start" — preach. 🙌

Most early-stage SaaS founders I talk to *know* they need cold email, but they get stuck on:
1. 3+ weeks of domain warmup
2. Writing personalized emails at scale
3. Managing deliverability/blacklists

Caesar's Legions removes all that friction:
• 48-hour setup (vs 3+ weeks warmup)
• AI writes personalized emails (GPT-4)
• We manage infrastructure end-to-end

Performance pricing: $50-100 per meeting booked. Zero monthly retainer.

If you're advising SaaS founders on outbound, this could be a great tool for your clients. Or if you do cold email for your own business, happy to run a pilot.

Worth a quick call?

– Kareem

```

**Expected Response:** "I don't need this personally, but have a few clients who might" OR "What verticals work best?"

## Prospect #4: Reddit $800K ARR Founder - P0 PRIORITY

**Context:** Explicit pain in Reddit post. $800K ARR B2B SaaS. Infrastructure nightmare (warmup, blacklists, inbox placement).

**Approach:** Direct solution to exact pain mentioned

**Status:** BLOCKED - Need Reddit username (browser automation unavailable)

**Draft DM (for when we get username):**
```
[Subject: Re: Cold email infrastructure nightmare]

Hey [Username],

Saw your post on r/SaaS about cold email infrastructure becoming a nightmare. The 3+ week warmup per domain pain is REAL.

Quick answer to your question: yes, people are cracking it. But they're either:
1. Agencies spending $10K+/mo on infrastructure
2. Tech-savvy operators who built custom systems

Caesar's Legions is the third path: Done-for-you cold email with AI personalization.

We handle:
✓ Domain setup + warmup (48 hours, not 3+ weeks)
✓ Inbox placement monitoring (real visibility, not platform BS)
✓ Blacklist management
✓ GPT-4 email personalization (targeting 4-5% reply rate vs 1-2% industry avg)

Performance pricing: Pay per meeting booked ($50-100), not per email sent.

At $800K ARR, you likely need 10-20 qualified demos/month to keep growing. That's ~5,000 emails/month at our target performance.

Zero infrastructure headache. Zero upfront risk.

Want to test 500 emails this week? I'll run it personally for the first pilot to ensure quality.

**Expected Response:** "What's the catch?" OR "Show me an example campaign" OR "What industries have you done this for?"
