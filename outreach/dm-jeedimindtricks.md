## Draft DM

Hey Rauno 👋

Saw your tweet about cold email not working for your invoicing tool.

Quick question: was it the *strategy* that failed, or the *execution*?

Most B2B founders try cold email once, get 0.2% reply rates, and assume the channel is dead. But I've seen the same companies get 4-5% replies with better personalization.

I'm launching an AI-powered cold email service (Caesar's Legions) and looking for 3 pilot clients. **No upfront cost** - you only pay per qualified meeting booked ($50-100 depending on volume).

Interested in testing it for your invoicing tool? I'd need:
- Your ICP (who's your perfect customer?)
- Your value prop (why switch from current invoicing?)
- 15 min to set up the campaign

If it works → you get meetings. If it doesn't → you pay nothing.

Worth a shot?

– Kareem

## Why This Works

1. **Pattern interrupt:** Question vs pitch
2. **Shared context:** References his specific pain ("cold email failed")
3. **Insight:** Explains why it probably failed (execution, not strategy)
4. **Risk reversal:** No upfront cost, pay-per-result
5. **Simple ask:** 15 min setup, low commitment
6. **Clear outcome:** Meetings or nothing

## Fallback (If No Reply After 3 Days)

Hey Rauno - no worries if you're exploring other channels!

Quick heads up: I'm documenting the entire $0→$10K journey of building Caesar's Legions on X.

If you're curious about cold email best practices (even if you do it yourself), might be worth a follow. Sharing real data + what actually works.

Cheers 🏛️
