# Founder Outreach Templates - V2 (Based on Jan 2026 Research)

## Template 1: "The Tool Stack Nightmare"

**Subject:** You using 5+ tools for cold outreach?

**Body:**
Hey {{firstName}},

Saw you're running {{companyName}}. Quick question:

Are you juggling Apollo/Instantly/Smartlead/Zapier for your outbound right now?

Most B2B founders I talk to are burning 10+ hours/week just keeping that stack from breaking.

We built something different: AI that handles the full workflow (lead research → personalization → sending → follow-ups) for $250/mo.

No tool management. No domain burning. Just qualified leads in your inbox.

Worth a 15min call to see if it fits?

Best,

## Template 2: "The Precision Angle"

**Subject:** Tired of spray-and-pray cold email?

**Body:**
{{firstName}},

I'm guessing you've tried cold email for {{companyName}} and got:

❌ 2% reply rates  
❌ Burned domain  
❌ Generic templates that sound like spam  

2026 playbook is different: Precision > Volume.

We send 100 hyper-personalized emails/week (AI-researched, ICP-filtered) vs 1,000 generic blasts.

Result: 15-20% reply rates, meetings with actual fit prospects.

$250/mo, no long-term contract.

Want to see the system? I'll walk you through it in 10 minutes.

## Template 3: "The Agency Alternative"

**Subject:** Lead gen agencies charging $15K/mo?

**Body:**
Hey {{firstName}},

Were you quoted $15K/month by a lead gen agency recently?

I get it. That's the going rate for "done-for-you" outbound.

Here's the thing: AI can now do 80% of what those agencies charge for.

We're $250/mo for:
- 100 personalized cold emails/week
- AI lead research (finds your ICP)
- Automated follow-ups
- Performance dashboard

It's like having a junior SDR, but smarter and 50x cheaper.

Interested? Let's talk.

## Template 4: "The Deliverability Play"

**Subject:** Domain health taking a hit from cold email?

**Body:**
{{firstName}},

If you're doing cold outreach for {{companyName}}, you've probably noticed:

Your primary domain's getting flagged as spam. Reply rates dropping every week.

That's because most tools blast from YOUR infrastructure.

We run campaigns from our warmed sending domains → your replies come to your inbox, but deliverability stays clean.

$250/mo. 100 personalized emails/week. Zero risk to your domain.

Want details?

## Template 5: "The Founder-to-Founder"

**Subject:** Built an AI cold email system (it's working)

**Body:**
Hey {{firstName}},

Fellow B2B founder here. Built {{companyName}} to solve my own problem:

I was spending 15 hrs/week on outbound (scraping leads, writing emails, managing follow-ups).

So I built an AI agent to do it. Now it runs 24/7, sends 100 personalized emails/week, books 3-5 demos/month.

Turning it into a service: $250/mo, done-for-you.

If you're doing outbound (or thinking about it), let's chat. I'll show you what's working.

## Template 6: "The Data Quality Angle"

**Subject:** Leadgen data accuracy killing your conversion?

**Body:**
{{firstName}},

Most cold email fails because of garbage data:

Wrong email. Wrong persona. Wrong company size.

You're not bad at outreach. Your list is just polluted.

We use AI to:
1. Find companies that match your ICP (real-time scraping)
2. Identify decision-makers
3. Verify emails before sending
4. Personalize based on recent activity

Result: 15-20% reply rates vs industry avg of 2-3%.

$250/mo for 100 quality leads/week.

Worth a quick call?

## Outreach Sequence (Full 3-Touch)

### Day 0: Initial Email
Use Template 1, 2, or 3 depending on prospect research

### Day 3: Follow-up
**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

Hey {{firstName}},

Following up on this. 

I know you're busy, so here's the TLDR:

We send 100 AI-personalized cold emails/week for your B2B SaaS → 15-20 qualified replies/month → $250/mo.

If lead gen is a priority for you in 2026, let's talk.

If not, no worries — good luck with {{companyName}}!

Caesar

### Day 7: Final Touch
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

{{firstName}},

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming cold email isn't a priority right now.

Before I archive this: One data point that might be relevant —

We're averaging 18% reply rates for our B2B SaaS clients (vs 2-3% industry avg).

If you want to see how, I'm happy to share the playbook (10 min call).

Otherwise, I'll leave you alone :)
