**Purpose:** Cold outreach to B2B SaaS founders for first 10 clients
**Based on:** Market research from 2026-01-31

## Template 1: Pain Point Direct (Reddit/Forum Response)

**When to use:** Responding to founders asking for lead gen help

**Subject:** Re: Your B2B lead gen question

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [specific pain point]. I'm building an AI agent system that handles the entire cold email process for B2B SaaS founders.

Instead of you writing emails, building lists, and managing campaigns — my agents do it:
- Research your ICP
- Build targeted prospect lists (Apollo)
- Write personalized emails (AI-powered)
- Run campaigns (Instantly)
- Optimize based on results

You just review and approve.

Running a free pilot for the first 5 founders. Interested in seeing what the agents come up with for [their company]?

## Template 2: X/Twitter DM (Cold Outreach)

**When to use:** Founders tweeting about outbound struggles

**Message:**
```
Hey [Name] - noticed you mentioned [specific tweet about outbound/leads].

Building something that might help: AI agents that run your entire cold email operation (research → lists → writing → sending → optimization).

Running free pilots for B2B SaaS founders to prove it works.

Want me to have the agents build a sample campaign for [their product]? No commitment, just curious if the AI gets your ICP right.
```

## Template 3: Value-First LinkedIn (Warm Connection)

**When to use:** After engaging with their content

**Subject:** Idea for [Company Name]'s outbound

**Body:**
```
[Name],

Love what you're building with [specific product feature].

I run AI agents that automate cold email for B2B SaaS companies. Thought experiment: what if you could get 15-20 qualified leads/month without writing a single email yourself?

That's what we're doing for our pilot clients.

The agents:
✓ Research your ideal customer profile
✓ Build targeted lists from 200M+ contacts
✓ Write personalized emails (not templates)
✓ Run & optimize campaigns
✓ You just approve before sending

Would this help [Company]'s growth? Happy to show you what the agents would create for your ICP (free, no strings).

Best,
Solon

## Template 4: Email (Warm Lead from Referral)

**When to use:** Someone mentioned them as a good fit

**Subject:** [Referrer] suggested we chat - AI-powered outbound

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

[Referrer] mentioned you're looking to scale [Company]'s outbound motion.

We just launched Caesar's Legions — AI agents that run your entire cold email operation:

**What you currently do:**
- Spend hours writing email sequences
- Manually build prospect lists
- Test what works through trial and error
- Manage campaigns yourself

**What our agents do:**
- Research your ICP & build personas
- Generate targeted prospect lists (Apollo API)
- Write personalized emails (AI, not templates)
- A/B test subject lines & messaging
- Send campaigns (Instantly integration)
- Optimize based on open/reply rates

You just: Review → Approve → Get leads

**Offer for early clients:**
First month free (you just cover email sending costs ~$37).
If it doesn't generate at least 3 qualified meetings, we refund the sending costs too.

Want to see what our agents would create for [Company]?

Best,

## Template 5: Follow-Up (No Response After 3 Days)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]

**Body:**
```
[Name],

Didn't hear back — probably buried in your inbox (happens).

Quick question: If I could get our AI agents to build you a complete cold email campaign (ICP, list, emails, everything) with ZERO time investment from you, would you at least want to see it?

Free pilot, no credit card, you just tell the agents "yes send" or "no thanks."

Reply YES or NO and I'll take it from there.

## Template 6: Free Value (No Pitch)

**When to use:** Building relationship first

**Subject:** Analyzed [Company]'s ICP - thoughts?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

I had our AI agents analyze potential ICPs for [Company] based on your site/positioning.

They came up with 3 segments that might be worth targeting for outbound:

1. [Segment 1 description]
2. [Segment 2 description]  
3. [Segment 3 description]

Curious if they got it right? (No pitch, just validating our tech)

If one of these resonates, happy to have the agents draft a sample campaign.

Cheers,
Solon

## Qualification Criteria (Who to Reach Out To)

**Must Have:**
- B2B SaaS product
- Founder or Head of Growth
- $5K-100K MRR (sweet spot: $10K-50K)

- Active on X/LinkedIn (shows they care about growth)

**Bonus Points:**
- Recently posted about lead gen struggles
- Tweeted about revenue goals
- Has budget ($100-500/mo range)

- Passive income seeker (wants automation to do everything)
