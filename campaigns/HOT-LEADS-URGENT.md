## LEAD 1: $300K BUDGET WHALE 🐋

**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/coldemail/comments/1pcsmjs/

**What they said:**
> "It's been over a decade since I've run large-scale cold email campaigns... I'll manage the economics/outcomes and assist with targeting/ICP scripts/messaging... Any tips on how to find the right/best agency? TLDR I've reached diminishing returns on inbound. Search volumes are declining. Its worth spending $300k sooner than later to increase leads than having to reduce sales headcount."

**Why they're perfect:**
- $300K budget explicitly stated
- Wants AGENCY not tools
- Experienced buyer (knows what they want)
- Urgent need (declining inbound, may have to cut sales team)
- Will help with ICP/messaging (low maintenance)

**DM to send:**
```
Hey! Saw your post about finding a cold email agency.

I run Caesar's Legions - we handle everything: infrastructure, deliverability, sequences, follow-ups. You provide the ICP and we book meetings.

We're different because:
1. Multi-channel (email + LinkedIn) for 3x reply rates
2. AI-personalized at scale (not templates)
3. Transparent - you see exactly what's happening via live dashboard
4. Results-based - meetings booked or money back

At $300K budget, you could run a serious operation. Happy to hop on a call and show you exactly how we'd approach your ICP.

What's the best email to send details?

## LEAD 2: MANAGED SENDING NEEDED

**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/coldemail/comments/1mdf1za/

**What they said:**
> "Our business is looking to hire a cold email consultant and/or agency to conduct 'managed sending' for us. We have the leads and content - just need a partner with sending infrastructure that can land in Microsoft inboxes."

**Why they're perfect:**
- Already have leads + content (minimal work for us)
- Just need sending infrastructure
- Specifically need Microsoft inbox deliverability
- Ready to hire NOW

Hey! Saw your post about managed sending.

We built Caesar's Legions exactly for this - we handle the infrastructure, deliverability, and sending. You provide leads + content, we make sure it lands in inboxes.

Microsoft inbox deliverability is our specialty (most providers struggle here).

What's the volume you're looking at? Happy to discuss how we'd handle it.

## LEAD 3: 30 SDRs, SCALING COLD EMAIL

**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/coldemail/comments/1qfzfjx/

**What they said:**
> "Looking for the right person to help advise or manage cold email infrastructure on a performance basis. We are rapidly scaling as we just scaled from 0 - 30 SDRs on the cold calling front. Would like to do the same with cold email."

**Why they're perfect:**
- Already scaled to 30 SDRs (proven they can execute)
- High ticket ($2500-3500/sale + $350/mo recurring)
- Open to performance basis (we align incentives)
- Clear ICP: construction/home service businesses
- ROI guarantee offer (easy to sell cold email to this market)

**DM to send:**
```
Hey! Saw your post about scaling cold email alongside your SDR team.

I run Caesar's Legions - we specialize in B2B cold email infrastructure + execution. 

Given your high-ticket offer ($2500-3500) with ROI guarantee, cold email is perfect for construction/home services. We can target decision-makers your SDRs might miss.

Happy to discuss a performance-based arrangement. What's the best way to connect?
