# URGENT DM Templates - Ready to Send

**Purpose:** First contact with high-value prospects who have fresh cold email pain  
**Tone:** Direct, helpful, no fluff  
**Goal:** Start conversation, not pitch

## Template 1: Taylor Haren (@THArrowOfApollo)

**Context:** Just burned $10.5K on cold email infrastructure failure, rebuilt in 30 days

**DM:**
```
Hey Taylor - saw your thread about burning $10.5K figuring out cold email deliverability. Been there. 

I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI agents that handle the entire cold email workflow (including the infrastructure nightmares that cost you 10K).

Would love to share what we learned preventing those exact mistakes. No pitch, just comparing notes with someone who's been in the trenches.

Worth 15 min?
```

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges his pain (recent, expensive)
- Offers value first (share learnings, no pitch)
- Respects his time (15 min ask)
- Shows we understand the problem deeply

**Follow-up (if no response in 3 days):**
```
Quick thought: The $10.5K lesson you shared probably saved dozens of founders from the same mistake.

We're documenting all the infrastructure gotchas into a playbook. Would you be open to reviewing it? Your experience would make it way better.
```

## Template 2: Marc Lou (@marc_louvion)

**Context:** Grew SaaS to $80K MRR with cold emails ONLY, teaches others

**DM:**
```
Marc - your $80K MRR story using only cold emails is exactly what I'm building toward.

I'm launching Caesar's Legions: AI agents that run the entire cold email operation (list building → personalization → follow-ups → tracking).

Since you teach cold email, curious: what's the #1 thing your students struggle with most?

Asking because we're building for founders doing their first 100 outreach emails, not agencies doing 10K/month.
```

**Why This Works:**
- References his achievement (social proof)
- Asks for his expertise (ego stroking, but genuine)
- Clarifies our ICP (first 100 emails = his students)
- Opens door to partnership/case study

**Follow-up (if no response in 3 days):**
```
Saw you're teaching cold email. Thought: would your students want a "First 100 Emails" playbook?

I can document our entire system (templates, sequencing, deliverability setup). If it's useful, happy to let you share it with your audience.

Win-win?
```

## Template 3: Andrew Gazdecki (@agazdecki)

**Context:** MicroAcquire founder, discussing cold email tools, knows market deeply

**DM:**
```
Andrew - following your takes on B2B SaaS. You nailed it that most cold email "tools" require too much expertise to actually work.

Building Caesar's Legions to fix that: AI agents that run the entire cold email operation, not just provide software.

Since you've seen hundreds of SaaS companies (via MicroAcquire), curious what you think of the "AI-enabled service" model vs traditional SaaS for cold email?

Would value your take.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges his expertise (MicroAcquire = credibility)
- Frames as seeking advice (not pitching)
- Asks strategic question he's qualified to answer
- Positions us as AI-enabled service (Henry Shi's thesis)

**Follow-up (if no response in 3 days):**
```
Quick question: You mentioned companies doing $495K/year in cold email tools.

Do you think there's room for a $5M/year AI-enabled service in the same space? Or is it too crowded?

Asking as a builder, not a buyer.
```

## Template 4: Henry Shi (@henrythe9ths)

**Context:** Advocates AI-enabled services over traditional SaaS, says old playbook is dead

**DM:**
```
Henry - your thread on AI-enabled services > traditional SaaS hit hard.

"Look for highly-paid people wasting time on spreadsheets" = exactly what we're doing with Caesar's Legions.

Cold email agencies charge $2-5K/mo. Founders spend 20 hours/week doing it themselves. We're using AI agents to deliver agency results at SaaS prices.

Is this the model you're advocating for? Or am I missing something?
```

**Why This Works:**
- Directly references his thesis
- Shows we understand his point
- Asks for validation/feedback
- Positions us as executing his vision

**Follow-up (if interested):**
```
Based on your AI-enabled services thesis, what do you think is the right pricing?

We're at $400/mo (vs $50/mo tools that don't work, or $2K/mo agencies).

Too high? Too low? Or just right?
```

## Template 5: Guillaume (@iamgdsa)

**Context:** Teaching $10K MRR playbook, says "DM and cold email get first customer at all cost"

**DM:**
```
Guillaume - your quote: "DM and cold email get the first paid user at all cost. Forget paid ads."

100% agree. But most founders mess up cold email because they don't know the technical stuff (deliverability, domain warming, etc).

Building Caesar's Legions to handle that: AI agents run the entire cold email workflow.

Since you teach the $10K MRR playbook, what would help your students most? Better templates? Automated follow-ups? Or just someone to handle the whole thing?
```

**Why This Works:**
- Quotes him directly (shows we listen)
- Identifies the gap (technical knowledge)
- Asks what his students need (opens partnership door)
- Framed as helping his audience, not selling to him

## SENDING STRATEGY

**Timing:**
- Send between 9 AM - 12 PM PST (when X DMs are most active)
- Stagger sends: don't blast all 5 at once (looks spammy)
- Wait 3 days before follow-up

**Tracking:**
- Log all DMs sent in `outreach-tracker.js`
- Track: sent_date, response_date, response_type, outcome
- Update prospect scores based on engagement

**Success Metrics:**
- Response rate goal: >30% (vs industry 4%)
- Meeting booked goal: >10% (vs industry 1%)
- Why higher: Hyper-targeted, pain-aware, not generic

## NEXT LEVEL DMs (After Rapport)

Once conversation started, move to:

1. **Value Share:** "Here's our deliverability playbook, thought you'd find it useful"
2. **Case Study Request:** "Would you be open to being a case study if we get you results?"
3. **Partnership Pitch:** "Your audience + our solution = win-win?"
4. **Direct Close:** "Want us to run your first 100 emails free? Just cover domain cost."
