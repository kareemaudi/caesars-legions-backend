## DM Option A (Direct Problem Solver)

Hey Rauno,

Saw your post about cold email failing for your invoicing tool.

I run an AI-powered cold email service specifically for B2B SaaS. Been experimenting with hyper-personalized outreach that actually gets replies (not the spammy stuff).

Would you be open to me running a free pilot campaign for you? No charge for the first 5 meetings booked. If it doesn't work, you pay nothing.

Only ask: Let me document the results (anonymously) for my own case study.

Interested?

## DM Option B (Casual Value-First)

Rauno - saw you mention cold email failed.

Quick thought: most cold email fails because it's too generic. What worked for my last client was extreme personalization (researching each lead manually, referencing their specific business challenges).

Running a few free pilot campaigns right now. If you're open to it, I could run one for your invoicing tool. First 5 meetings = free. After that, $200/meeting if you want to continue.

No pressure - just figured I'd offer since you mentioned the pain point.

## DM Option C (Permission-First)

Hey Rauno,

Noticed your tweet about cold email not working for your B2B invoicing tool.

I've been building an AI service that handles hyper-personalized cold email for SaaS founders. Would you be open to a quick convo about what went wrong with your cold email attempts?

Not selling anything - genuinely curious. And if it makes sense, I might be able to help.

## Recommended: Option A
**Why:** Direct, clear offer, removes all risk, addresses his exact pain point.

**Follow-up (if no response in 3 days):**
"No worries if cold email isn't a priority right now. Curious though - what ended up working to get your first users? Always learning from other founders."

## Notes for Kareem
- This is a WARM lead (explicit pain point)
- Free pilot = zero risk for him, high potential for case study for us
- If he says yes, this becomes our proof before scaling
- Timeline: Send DM within 24 hours (Friday daytime)
