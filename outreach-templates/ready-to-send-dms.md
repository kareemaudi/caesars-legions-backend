## 🔥 PRIORITY 1: Taylor Haren (@THArrowOfApollo) - SEND TONIGHT

**Why urgent:** Just burned $10.5K on cold email infrastructure failure. Pain is fresh. Sending 300K emails/month = serious budget.

**Platform:** X/Twitter DM  
**Handle:** @THArrowOfApollo

**Message:**

```
Hey Taylor,

Saw your thread about burning $10.5K rebuilding RB2B's cold email infrastructure. 300K emails/month at 34% reply rate is seriously impressive.

I'm building Caesar's Legions—AI agents that handle cold email infrastructure end-to-end (research, personalization, sending, deliverability monitoring). Different approach from traditional tools.

Since you just rebuilt everything and know exactly what breaks at scale, I'd love to get your take on what we're building. Worth a quick call?

Kareem

```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges his specific pain ($10.5K)
- Shows respect for his results (34% reply rate)
- Positions as learning opportunity, not sales pitch
- He has budget + proven need

**Expected outcome:** 40-60% response rate (fresh pain, relevant solution)

**Next steps if he responds:**
1. Book 15-min call within 48 hours
2. Demo the system
3. Offer beta spot: $250/mo (50% off first 3 clients)
4. If yes: Onboard within 24 hours

## 🎯 PRIORITY 2: Marc Lou (@marc_louvion) - SEND WITHIN 24H

**Why high priority:** Grew to $80K using only cold email. Teaching others. Potential partner/amplifier.

**Platform:** X/Twitter DM  
**Handle:** @marc_louvion

**Message:**

```
Hey Marc,

Saw your thread about growing to $80K using cold emails only. Really impressive, especially with zero ad spend.

I'm building Caesar's Legions—AI agents that automate the cold email process you teach (research → personalization → sending → follow-ups). Built entirely by AI agent Caesar (yes, an AI building a business).

Since you've proven cold email works at scale, would love your feedback on what we're building. Could also help your students get results faster.

Curious to chat?

Kareem

**Why this works:**
- Flattery (recognizes his achievement)
- Partnership angle, not sales
- Mentions AI building business (unique story)
- Could help his students (value to him)

**Expected outcome:** 30-40% response rate (not urgent pain, but interesting story)

**Next steps if he responds:**
1. Offer feedback call (position as advisor, not buyer)
2. Demo the system
3. Ask: "Would your students benefit from this?"
4. Explore partnership (affiliate, case study, or direct use)

## 🎯 PRIORITY 3: Andrew Gazdecki (@agazdecki) - BUILD RAPPORT FIRST

**Why high priority:** MicroAcquire founder, knows the market deeply, well-connected.

**Platform:** X/Twitter  
**Handle:** @agazdecki

**Strategy:** DON'T DM immediately. Build rapport first (1-2 weeks).

**Phase 1: Engagement (This week)**

Reply to 2-3 of his tweets about:
- SaaS businesses he lists
- Cold email tools
- B2B growth strategies

**Example replies:**
- "The $495K cold email SaaS you listed—AI-powered angle is smart. We're seeing the same trend: cold email automation is becoming commodity, real value is in AI personalization at scale."
- "Agree on [whatever he posts about]. Built Caesar's Legions to solve exactly this for B2B SaaS founders."

**Phase 2: DM (After 3-5 engagements)**

```
Hey Andrew,

Been following your posts about B2B SaaS valuations—really insightful.

I'm building Caesar's Legions (AI-powered cold email service). Since you see dozens of SaaS companies through MicroAcquire, curious for your take on where the cold email market is headed.

Would love 15 minutes to get your feedback.

**Why this approach:**
- He's high-profile (gets lots of DMs)
- Relationship > immediate sale
- Potential advisor/investor/amplifier

**Expected outcome:** 20-30% response rate (busy guy, but interesting angle)

## 📍 PRIORITY 4: Hivepoint.io Founder (Reddit) - SEND WITHIN 48H

**Why high priority:** Actively frustrated with existing tools, built own solution, understands cold email.

**Platform:** Reddit DM (or find on X)  
**Reddit thread:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mlm2nd/cold_email_for_b2b_isnt_dead/

**Message:**

```
Subject: Saw your Hivepoint results (2% reply, 12 demos!)

Hey [Name from Reddit username],

Saw your post about Hivepoint's cold email results—2% reply rate and 12 demos is solid. You mentioned wanting better personalization beyond {{firstName}}.

I built Caesar's Legions to solve exactly that—AI agents that research each lead and write truly personalized emails (not templates). Built by AI agent Caesar (yes, an AI building a business).

Since you're actively using cold email and frustrated with existing tools, want to compare notes? First 500 emails on us.

- References specific results (proves you read his post)
- Addresses his stated pain (personalization)
- Offers free trial (low friction)

**Expected outcome:** 30-40% response rate (relevant pain + free trial)

Hey [Name],

Read your post about struggling to get Primapost in front of users. "If nobody knows about it, it'll just end up being nothing"—felt that hard.

Built entirely by AI agent Caesar (yes, an AI building a business). First 500 emails free for fellow indie hackers.

- Empathy (acknowledges his struggle)
- Clear value prop (100 prospects/week)
- Affordable price ($250/mo for college student)
- Free trial (removes risk)
- Fellow builder angle

**Expected outcome:** 50-60% response rate (desperate for solution + free trial)

**Next steps if he responds:**
1. Onboard immediately (he needs customers NOW)
2. Run first campaign within 48 hours
3. Get testimonial/case study for future marketing

## 📍 PRIORITY 6: Guillaume (@iamgdsa) - BUILD RAPPORT FIRST

**Why medium priority:** Teaching others cold email, not current pain, but potential amplifier.

**Platform:** X/Twitter  
**Handle:** @iamgdsa

**Strategy:** Engage with content first, then DM.

**Phase 1: Engagement**

Reply to his tweets about:
- Building $10K MRR SaaS

**Phase 2: DM (After 2-3 engagements)**

```
Hey Guillaume,

Love your content on building $10K MRR SaaS with cold email. "DM and cold email get the first paid user at all cost"—100% agree.

I'm building Caesar's Legions to automate exactly that process for founders (AI agents handle research → personalization → sending). Built entirely by AI agent Caesar.

Since you teach this to others, curious for your feedback. Could also help your audience get results faster.

Worth a quick chat?
