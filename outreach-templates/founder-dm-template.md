# Founder DM Template - Caesar's Legions

## Context
Target: B2B SaaS founders actively doing cold outreach (10-100+ employees, $10K-$500K MRR range)

## Template 1: Pain Point Response (Best for Reddit/IH posts about cold email)

```
Hey [Name],

Just read your post about [specific pain point, e.g., "Apollo emails landing in spam"]. 

We built Caesar's Legions to solve exactly this—AI agents that handle the entire cold email workflow (research → personalization → sending → follow-ups) while keeping deliverability high.

Currently in beta with a few early customers. Would you be open to trying it? First 500 emails free.

[Your name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Shows you read their content (not mass spam)
- Addresses their specific pain
- Low-friction offer (free trial)
- Short (3 sentences)

## Template 2: Value-First Approach (For founders not actively complaining)

```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're building [their product]. Cold email must be a big part of your customer acquisition.

We're launching Caesar's Legions—AI agents that automate cold outreach end-to-end (research, writing, sending, follow-ups). Getting 30-40% reply rates for our beta customers.

Worth a 15-min call to show you how it works?

```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges their product (shows research)
- States clear value prop + social proof
- Simple CTA

## Template 3: Competitor User (For people using Instantly, Smartlead, Lemlist)

```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you use [competitor tool]. How's it working for you?

We built Caesar's Legions as an alternative—instead of just sending emails, our AI agents handle the full workflow: research → personalize → send → follow-up.

Early customers are seeing 2-3x better reply rates. Want to compare results?

[Your name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Opens with question (engagement)
- Positions as alternative, not replacement
- Specific metric (2-3x better)
- Competitive angle

## Template 4: Jason Calacanis Angle (For high-achievers)

```
Hey [Name],

Read about [their achievement, e.g., "how you closed your first $8.4K with cold email"]. Impressive.

We're building Caesar's Legions to scale what you did manually—AI agents that research leads, write personalized emails, and handle follow-ups automatically.

Since you've seen cold email work at scale, would love your feedback on what we're building.

[Your name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Flattery + acknowledgment
- Positions them as advisor, not buyer (lower pressure)
- Appeals to their expertise

---

## Follow-Up Template (If no response after 3-5 days)

```
Hey [Name],

Following up on my message about Caesar's Legions.

Quick question: Are you still actively doing cold outreach, or have you moved to other channels?

If cold email is still part of your strategy, happy to share how we're getting 30-40% reply rates for our beta customers.

[Your name]
```

**Why it works:**
- Asks a question (hard to ignore)
- Acknowledges they might not be interested (pressure off)
- Restates value prop briefly

## Personalization Checklist

Before sending, verify:
- [ ] Used their actual name (not [Name])
- [ ] Referenced something specific from their profile/post
- [ ] Kept it under 4 sentences
- [ ] One clear CTA (question or action)
- [ ] No typos or template artifacts
- [ ] Sounds human, not robotic

## Platform-Specific Notes

**X (Twitter) DMs:**
- Max 280 chars in preview—hook them fast
- Use line breaks for readability
- Can include screenshot/GIF if relevant

**LinkedIn:**
- Connection request message: 1-2 sentences max
- Wait for acceptance before full pitch
- Reference mutual connections if any

**Email (if you have it):**
- Subject line: Keep it curious, not salesy
  - "Quick question about [their company]"
  - "Saw your post about [topic]"
  - NOT: "Revolutionary cold email solution!"
- Signature: Name, title, website

## Red Flags (DON'T DO)

❌ Generic "I hope this finds you well"  
❌ Long paragraphs (wall of text)  
❌ Multiple CTAs (confusing)  
❌ Asking for meeting in first message (too much commitment)  
❌ Mentioning price upfront (scares people away)  
❌ Being pushy or desperate

## Success Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Response rate | 10-20% | Any reply (yes/no/maybe) |
| Positive responses | 3-5% | "Tell me more" or "Let's talk" |
| Meetings booked | 1-2% | Actual calendar invite accepted |
| Conversion to customer | 0.5-1% | From DM to paying |

**Benchmark:** If response rate <10%, iterate messaging. If >20%, scale up volume.

---

## Next Steps After Positive Response

1. **Acknowledge fast** (<2 hours)
2. **Book meeting** (Calendly link or suggest 2-3 times)
3. **Send confirmation** with what to expect
4. **Before call:** Research their company deeply
5. **After call:** Follow up within 24 hours with next steps

---

**Remember:** Sales is a numbers game. Send 10-20 DMs per day, track what works, iterate fast.
