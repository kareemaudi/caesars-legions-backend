# X/Twitter DM Templates - Caesar's Legions

**Purpose:** Ready-to-send DMs for qualified leads  
**Usage:** Personalize minimally, send within 24-48h of engagement  
**Tone:** Collaborative, curious, not salesy

---

## Template #1: For Taylor Haren (@THArrowOfApollo)

**Context:** Just burned $10.5K rebuilding cold email infrastructure, sending 300K emails/month

**Subject:** (No subject on X DMs)

**Message:**
```
Hey Taylor,

Saw your thread about burning $10.5K on RB2B's cold email infrastructure. 300K emails/month at 34% reply rate is seriously impressive.

I'm building Caesar's Legions - an AI agent that handles email generation + infrastructure. Different approach from the traditional tools (AI writes truly personalized emails, not just templates).

Curious what broke in your setup and what you rebuilt? Always learning from people operating at that scale.

- Kareem

P.S. Building in public ($0→$10K MRR). Backend's live if you want to poke around: [link]
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges his expertise (300K emails, 34% reply rate)
- Leads with curiosity, not pitch
- Shows we operate at similar level (building AI solution)
- P.S. provides credibility without being pushy

**Follow-up (if no reply in 3 days):**
```
Also - what you said about sender names killing deliverability in 2025 really resonates. We're tackling that differently (AI rotates patterns to avoid spam filters). Would love to swap notes if you're open to it.
```

## Template #2: For Marc Lou (@marc_louvion)

**Context:** Grew SaaS to $80K using cold emails, teaching others

**Subject:** (No subject on X DMs)

**Message:**
```
Hey Marc,

Your $80K cold email thread was 🔥. Love that you did it all for $0 (scraping TripAdvisor/Yelp is brilliant).

I'm building Caesar's Legions - an AI agent that automates the personalization part of what you teach. Not a tool you use - an actual AI agent that researches prospects and writes personalized emails.

Thinking about offering it to people learning your method. Could help them get results faster.

Want to compare notes? Would love to hear what parts your students struggle with most.

- Kareem

P.S. Building in public. Caesar (the AI) posts progress daily: @agenticCaesar
```

**Why this works:**
- Validates his success ($80K proof)
- Shows we understand his method
- Partnership angle (help his students, not compete)
- Curiosity about student pain points

**Follow-up (if no reply in 5 days):**
```
Also curious - when you teach your method, what's the #1 thing people get stuck on? Scraping? Personalization? Deliverability? Trying to figure out where AI can help most.
```

## Template #3: For Andrew Gazdecki (@agazdecki)

**Context:** MicroAcquire founder, listed $495K cold email SaaS, deep market knowledge

**Subject:** (No subject on X DMs)

**Message:**
```
Hey Andrew,

Saw you listed that $495K cold email SaaS on acquired.com. AI-powered reply handling is smart.

I'm building Caesar's Legions - an AI agent that writes personalized cold emails. Not a tool, an actual autonomous agent. Built in public, $0→$10K MRR journey.

Curious for your take: where do you see the cold email market heading? We're betting on "AI agents > SaaS tools" but you've seen way more companies in this space than I have.

Would love 5 minutes of your brain if you're open to it.

- Kareem

P.S. Caesar (the AI agent) posts daily progress: @agenticCaesar. It's... weird in a good way.
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges his expertise (MicroAcquire, market knowledge)
- Asks for advice, not selling
- Shows unique angle (AI agent vs tool)
- Building in public = credibility
- P.S. creates curiosity

**Follow-up (if no reply in 7 days):**
```
Also - any portfolio companies struggling with cold email? Happy to offer beta access (or just swap notes on what's working in 2026). Market's changing fast.
```

## Template #4: For Sahil S (@sahils_r)

**Context:** Frustrated with cold emails to VCs getting zero replies

**Subject:** (No subject on X DMs)

**Message:**
```
Hey Sahil,

Saw your tweet about cold emails to VCs getting zero replies. Been there - it's brutal.

Not pitching, but curious: what approach have you tried? Generic templates? Personalized? Warm intros?

I'm building an AI agent (Caesar's Legions) that writes truly personalized emails. Different from templates. Testing it on B2B SaaS cold email first, but the approach would work for VCs too.

If you want to swap notes, happy to share what's working (and what's not).

- Kareem
```

**Why this works:**
- Empathy first (understands frustration)
- Curiosity about his approach
- Offers value (swap notes)
- Not selling (yet)

## Template #5: For Guillaume (@iamgdsa)

**Context:** Teaching how to build $10K MRR SaaS, emphasizes cold email + DM

**Subject:** (No subject on X DMs)

**Message:**
```
Hey Guillaume,

Your "$10K MRR SaaS" thread was gold. "DM and cold email get the first paid user at all cost" - 100% agree.

I'm building Caesar's Legions - an AI agent that automates cold email outreach. Built in public, $0→$10K MRR journey.

The meta is: using AI cold email to sell AI cold email 😅

Want to swap notes on what's working in 2026? Curious what you're teaching people about cold email specifically.

- Kareem

P.S. Caesar (the AI agent) posts progress: @agenticCaesar
```

**Why this works:**
- Validates his teaching
- Meta angle is interesting (AI selling AI)
- Collaborative tone
- Building in public = credibility

## General Principles

**DO:**
- ✅ Lead with curiosity, not pitch
- ✅ Acknowledge their expertise/success
- ✅ Offer value (swap notes, share learnings)
- ✅ Keep it short (3-4 paragraphs max)
- ✅ Personalize based on their specific content
- ✅ Include building-in-public angle (credibility)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Pitch immediately (build rapport first)
- ❌ Generic messages (they get 100s)
- ❌ Ask for too much time upfront
- ❌ Mention price (way too early)
- ❌ Sound desperate
- ❌ Use salesy language ("revolutionizing", "game-changer")

---

## Engagement Before DM

**For ALL leads:**
1. Follow them
2. Like + thoughtful reply to 2-3 recent posts
3. Add genuine value (not "great post!")
4. Wait 24-48 hours
5. THEN send DM

**Why:** Warm up the relationship. People check who DMs them. If they see you engaged thoughtfully with their content, they're 10x more likely to reply.

---

## Timing

**Best times to send DMs (US-based founders):**
- 9-11 AM ET (when checking X over coffee)
- 7-9 PM ET (evening scroll)

**Avoid:**
- Weekends (unless they're very active on weekends)
- Late night (looks desperate)

---

## Success Metrics

**Track in:** `memory/outreach-metrics.jsonl`

```json
{
  "date": "2026-01-30",
  "dms_sent": 1,
  "replies": 0,
  "meetings_booked": 0,
  "clients_closed": 0,
  "handle": "@THArrowOfApollo",
  "template_used": "Template #1"
}
```

**Goal:** 
- 50% reply rate (5/10 leads)
- 20% meeting rate (2/10 leads)
- 10% client rate (1/10 leads)

If hitting these numbers → scale to 50 DMs/week

---

**Remember:** These are real people, not numbers. Be genuine, be curious, be valuable.
