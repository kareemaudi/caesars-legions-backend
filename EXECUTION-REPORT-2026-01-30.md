#### Prospect #1: r/b2bmarketing (FIT SCORE: 95/100)
**Post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/b2bmarketing/comments/1p2muq8/struggling_to_market_my_b2b_saas_anyone_been_in/

**DM to send:**
```
Hey! Saw your post in r/b2bmarketing. I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI-powered cold email specifically for B2B SaaS founders in your exact situation.

You mentioned struggling with reaching decision-makers and booking demos. That's exactly what we solve.

Early access is free for first 5 clients (I need case studies). Interested in a 15-min call this week?

If not, no worries - but I'd be happy to share what's working for us with outbound right now.

#### Prospect #2: r/SaaS (FIT SCORE: 98/100 - HIGHEST URGENCY)
**Post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1oi39da/how_did_you_get_your_first_10_b2b_customers_and/

**Their pain:** "Without a network, it's actually very tough. SEO takes time and cold emails not guaranteed. I am stuck in this phase for a long time."

**DM to send:**
```
Hey! Your post about getting first 10 B2B customers really resonated.

"Cold emails not guaranteed" - you're right. Most cold email fails because it's generic.

I'm building Caesar's Legions: AI-powered cold email that learns from every campaign. Not another Instantly clone.

First 5 clients get it FREE for month 1 (I need case studies).

Want to be one of them? 15-min call this week?

#### Prospect #3: Comment in r/DigitalMarketing thread
**Thread:** https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/1q84ldz/cold_email_works_in_2026_only_if_you_have_proper/

**Action:** Reply publicly to the THREAD (not DM):
```
This is exactly why I built Caesar's Legions.

Proper cold email infrastructure costs $2K-$5K/mo with most agencies.

We're doing it for $500/mo using AI:
→ Custom targeting per client
→ Self-improving campaigns
→ Full infrastructure included

Early access (5 spots): Month 1 free, $500/mo after.

DM if interested.
```

**Why public reply:** Adds social proof, others in thread might reach out

---

### ACTION 3: Search X for 7 More Prospects (10 min)

**Go to X and search these exact phrases:**

1. **"struggling with outbound"** - Find recent posts
2. **"cold email not working"** - Look for frustrated founders
3. **"need help with B2B sales"** - Active problem-seekers
4. **"how to get first customers"** - Early-stage founders

**For each person you find:**
- Check their bio (are they a founder?)
- Check followers (500+ = credible)
- Check posts (active in last 7 days?)
- If YES to all → Send DM

**DM template (customize per person):**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [specific thing]. I'm building Caesar's Legions - AI-powered cold email for B2B SaaS founders.

Early access is FREE for first 5 clients (need case studies).

15-min call this week?

- Kareem
```

**Goal:** Send 7 more DMs = 10 total outreach today

---

### ACTION 4: Post Tweet #2 (In 1 hour)

**Set phone reminder for 1 hour from first tweet.**

**When it goes off, post this:**
```
Lesson learned today:

Don't wait for perfect infrastructure.

Caesar's Legions backend is ready but I was waiting for API keys.

Wrong move.

Going manual for Client #1:
→ Gmail instead of Instantly
→ Google Sheets instead of CRM
→ Manual research instead of Apollo

Ship > perfect.
```

---

### ACTION 5: Engage on X (5 min)

**Search:** "cold email" on X

**Reply to 3 posts with helpful advice** (not pitching):

Example replies:
- "What's your ICP? Targeting makes or breaks cold email."
- "How many follow-ups are you sending? Most replies come on email 3-5."
- "Subject line tip: Ask a question instead of making a statement."

**Goal:** Build presence, show expertise
