```

**2. Reply to These Accounts:**

(Build rapport first, pitch later)

## 🎯 Phase 2: Outreach Script (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Initial DM (X/Twitter):
```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're building [product] - love the approach to [specific thing from their profile].

Quick question: how are you currently handling outbound sales? 

I'm building an AI-powered cold email service specifically for B2B SaaS founders like you. Early access is free for first 5 clients (I need case studies).

Interested in a 15-min call this week?

```

### Follow-Up (if no response in 48h):
```
[Name] - following up on my previous message.

No pressure, but I'm capping this at 5 early clients and already have 2 spots filled.

If you're struggling with outbound, happy to show you what we're building. Takes 5 minutes.

Free for first month + you keep all the email templates we build for you.
```

## 🎯 Phase 3: Qualification Call (15 min)

### Questions to Ask:
1. "Walk me through your current outbound process"
2. "What's your average customer LTV?"
3. "How many leads do you need per month to hit your revenue goals?"
4. "What have you tried before that didn't work?"
5. "If we could get you 10 qualified meetings per month, what would that be worth?"

### Qualification Criteria:
✅ They have budget ($500-$1K/mo range)
✅ They have ICP clarity (know who their customer is)
✅ They're actively selling (not pre-launch)
✅ They respond quickly (signal they're serious)

❌ "Can we do free trial first?" (tire kickers)
❌ "I'll think about it" (not urgent enough)
❌ Pre-revenue (<$5K MRR means no budget)

## 🎯 Phase 4: Close the Deal (Same Call)

"Here's what I'm thinking:

Let's run a test campaign for you - 200 emails this week, zero cost.

If we get you at least 3 qualified meetings, you pay $500/mo starting next month.

If we don't, you owe nothing and keep the templates we built.

I'll have your first campaign ready to review by [Day + 2].

Sound fair?"
```
