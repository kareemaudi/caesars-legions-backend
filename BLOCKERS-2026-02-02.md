# 🚧 Current Blockers - February 2, 2026

**Status:** System ready, waiting on 3 critical items

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocks First Client)

### 1. Apollo.io Credits Exhausted

**Impact:** Can't auto-research prospects  
**Current:** API returns "insufficient credits" error  
**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Upgrade Apollo (Recommended)**
- Visit: https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/plans/upgrade
- Cost: ~$49/mo for Basic plan (unlimited searches)
- Benefit: Automated prospect research every 6 hours

**Option B: Manual Research (Free, slower)**
- Follow guide: `research/MANUAL-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md`
- Time: 2-3 hours per 10 prospects
- Use X search + Reddit + Indie Hackers
- Already built scoring system to prioritize leads

**Next Step:** Choose Option A or execute Option B today

---

### 2. Stripe API Key Missing

**Impact:** Can't accept payments (currently in dev mode)  
**Current:** Signup works but no money collected  
**Solution:**

1. Create Stripe account: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Get API keys: Dashboard → Developers → API keys
3. Add to Railway:
   ```bash
   railway variables set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   railway variables set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```
4. Test payment flow

**Urgency:** HIGH (need before first client signs up)

---

### 3. Clawdbot Gateway Not Running

**Impact:** Can't set up automated cron jobs (follow-ups, reports)  
**Current:** Gateway timeout when trying to access cron system  
**Solution:**

```bash
clawdbot gateway start
```

Then set up automated follow-ups:
```bash
cron action=add \
  schedule="0 */6 * * *" \
  text="Run Caesar's Legions follow-up automation: cd caesars-legions-backend && node cron/process-follow-ups.js --live" \
  contextMessages=0
```

**Urgency:** MEDIUM (need before first campaign launches)

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Improves Conversion)

### 4. Custom Domain Not Routing

**Issue:** promptabusiness.com doesn't route to Railway app  
**Current:** Using long Railway URL (unprofessional)  
**Solution:** Check Railway domain settings + DNS records

### 5. Calendly Link Missing

**Issue:** Onboarding email has placeholder `[YOUR-LINK]`  
**Solution:**
1. Create Calendly account: https://calendly.com/signup
2. Set up 15-min "Caesar's Legions Onboarding" event
3. Update `.env`: `CALENDLY_LINK=https://calendly.com/your-username/onboarding`

---

## 🟢 NICE TO HAVE

### 6. Support Channels Setup

**Missing:**
- Support email (support@promptabusiness.com)
- Telegram channel for client alerts

### 7. Logo & Branding

**Missing:** Caesar's Legions logo for Stripe checkout

## 📊 Work Completed This Session

**Built (Feb 2, 10:46 AM):**
1. **Prospect Scoring System** (`lib/prospect-scorer.js`)
   - Scores prospects 0-100 based on fit
   - Factors: title, company size, activity, pain signals
   - Provides outreach template recommendations

2. **Research Automation Script** (`scripts/research-prospects.js`)
   - Integrates with Apollo.io API
   - Enriches with Twitter data
   - Batch processes and prioritizes leads

3. **Manual Research Guide** (`research/MANUAL-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md`)
   - Step-by-step X/Twitter search strategies
   - Qualification checklist
   - Alternative sources (Reddit, IH, Product Hunt)
   - 2-3 hour workflow to find 10 hot prospects

**Why This Matters:**
Even with Apollo blocked, you can now:
- Find prospects manually (guided process)
- Score them objectively (0-100)
- Prioritize outreach (hot/warm/cold)
- Track research over time

**Next Session Prep:**
Once blockers are resolved, the system can:
- Auto-research 25 prospects every 6 hours
- Score and prioritize them
- Alert you when hot leads appear
- Integrate with outreach automation

## 💡 Recommended Next Action

**Path A: Fast Start (Manual Research)**
1. Read `research/MANUAL-RESEARCH-GUIDE.md`
2. Spend 2 hours on X finding 10 prospects
3. Send 10 DMs today (OUTREACH-PLAYBOOK.md has templates)
4. Goal: First call booked by Wednesday

**Path B: Automated Setup (Takes longer upfront)**
1. Upgrade Apollo ($49/mo)
2. Start Clawdbot gateway
3. Set up Stripe
4. System runs 24/7 finding prospects automatically

**My Recommendation:** Do both!
- Manual research TODAY (get first client ASAP)
- Set up automation THIS WEEK (scale to 10+ clients)

---

🏛️ **Bottom Line:** We're 95% ready. The blockers are external (credits, accounts, gateway). You can either unblock with accounts/money, or bypass with manual work. Either way, first client is 2-3 days away.**

**Next Heartbeat:** Build next feature or run manual research if unblocked
