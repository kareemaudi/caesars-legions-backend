## 🔴 BLOCKERS (Need Human Action)

### 1. Apollo.io Credits Exhausted
**Impact:** Can't auto-research prospects  
**Solution:** Upgrade to Basic plan ($49/mo) OR continue manual research (2-3 hrs per 10 prospects)  
**Workaround:** Manual research guide built, already used successfully today

### 2. Stripe API Key Missing
**Impact:** Can't accept payments (dev mode only)  
**Solution:** Create Stripe account → Get API keys → Add to Railway  
**Urgency:** HIGH (needed before first client signs up)

### 3. Clawdbot Gateway Not Running
**Impact:** Can't schedule automated follow-ups via cron  
**Solution:** Run `clawdbot gateway start`  
**Urgency:** MEDIUM (needed before first campaign launches)
