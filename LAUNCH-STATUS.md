## 🎯 MVP Scope (What We're Selling This Week)

**Offer:** "I'll run your cold email campaign for you using AI agents"

**Deliverables:**
1. AI researches your target audience
2. AI writes personalized emails (you approve batch)
3. We send via email (50-100/day to start)
4. AI handles follow-ups (3-day, 7-day)
5. You get daily report on replies

**Price:** $99/mo OR $500 for first campaign (test pricing)

**Limitations (be honest):**
- Manual approval needed (building auto-approve)
- Daily send limit: 100 emails/day (scale up based on results)
- Reporting is manual for now (building dashboard)
- You need to close deals yourself (we get leads)

## 🎬 What to Do Right Now

### Option 1: Test Everything (Safe)
1. Send test email to Kareem's personal email
2. Run full campaign simulation (5 test emails)
3. Verify deliverability & quality
4. THEN reach out to real leads

### Option 2: Ship Fast (Aggressive)
1. DM @ArnaudBelingaCX right now (strongest pain point)
2. Offer to run free test campaign (25 emails)
3. If he says yes: Execute tomorrow
4. Use results as case study for others

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (bias toward action)

## 💡 Lessons from Similar Launches

From research on successful cold email founders:

1. **Marc Lou ($80K from cold email):**
   - Started with manual everything
   - Focused on deliverability over volume
   - Personal touch > automation in early days

2. **Taylor Haren (300K emails/month):**
   - Took time to perfect copy (A/B testing 6 variants)
   - Small changes = huge impact on reply rates
   - Infrastructure matters less than message quality

3. **Arnaud (15K emails/month, cost complaints):**
   - Pain point = expensive tools for high volume
   - Our advantage: AI labor is cheap, scale infinitely
   - Compete on cost AND quality

**Our Edge:** We automate what they do manually, at lower cost than Clay/other tools, with better personalization.
