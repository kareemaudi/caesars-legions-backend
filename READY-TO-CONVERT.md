## What Was Built (This Session)

### ✅ Client Signup System

**The Problem:**  
We can find leads and send DMs, but when they say "yes" — what next? We had no way to convert interest → payment.

**The Solution:**  
Built complete end-to-end signup flow:

1. **Landing page** (`signup.html`)
   - Professional design
   - $250/mo early bird pricing
   - Feature list, testimonials, guarantee
   - Mobile-responsive

2. **Backend integration** (`signup-handler.js`)
   - Creates client record
   - Generates Stripe checkout
   - Handles payment webhooks
   - Sends onboarding email
   - Notifies team via Telegram

3. **Auto-onboarding**
   - Welcome email with next steps
   - Dashboard access link
   - Calendly booking
   - Support contacts

---

## Impact

**Before:** Interested lead → manual Stripe link → manual follow-up → friction  
**After:** Interested lead → signup.html → paid → onboarded (fully automated)

**This unlocks revenue.**

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** (5 min)
   - Set Stripe keys in env
   - Configure webhook
   - Test end-to-end

2. **Resume prospecting** (tomorrow AM)
   - Need 6 more DM targets (4/10 complete)
   - Send 10 personalized DMs
   - Include signup link in pitch

3. **First client goal:** 48 hours
