## Thread:

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Built Caesar's Legions to $0 → $10K MRR.

Day 3: Just shipped global unsubscribe list.

Most cold email tools treat compliance as an afterthought.

Here's why that's stupid (and how we fixed it): 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
CAN-SPAM Act requires:
- Unsubscribe link in EVERY email
- Process opt-outs within 10 days
- Never email unsubscribed users again

Most services make YOU track this manually.

We built it at the infrastructure level.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Solution):**
Our approach:

1. Global unsubscribe list (across ALL campaigns)
2. Auto-enforcement at email-sender layer
3. Webhook integration with ESP
4. One-click unsubscribe (no login required)

Code: caesars-legions-backend/lib/unsubscribe-list.js

**Tweet 4 (Why It Matters):**
Why this matters:

❌ Manual tracking = human error
❌ Per-campaign lists = people still get emails
❌ Compliance violations = $46,517 fine per email

✅ Infrastructure-level = impossible to mess up

Your sender reputation is worth more than one more email.

**Tweet 5 (The Numbers):**
