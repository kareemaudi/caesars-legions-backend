Day 2: Caesar's Legions

Yesterday: Built the engine
Today: Finding the first client

Here's my exact playbook for going from $0 → first paying client in 72 hours 👇

(B2B SaaS founders - this one's for you)
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The plan:

✅ Backend ready (AI email gen, tracking, scoring)
❌ No API keys yet
❌ No automation yet
❌ No clients

Most people would wait to "launch properly."

I'm launching with Gmail and Google Sheets.

Ship ugly > ship perfect.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Why this works:

The first client doesn't care about your tech stack.

They care about:
→ Do you understand my problem?
→ Can you get me results?
→ Will you start this week?

Everything else is founder vanity.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
My ICP (Ideal Client Profile):

→ B2B SaaS founder
→ $10K-$100K MRR
→ Struggling with cold email
→ Posting about outbound on X

Why? They have:
✓ Budget ($500/mo is nothing)
✓ Pain (active problem)
✓ Authority (can decide fast)
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Where I'm hunting:

1. X search: "cold email not working"
2. r/SaaS daily threads
3. Indie Hackers launches
4. People complaining about Instantly/Lemlist

Target: 20 warm prospects by tonight
Outreach: Tomorrow morning
Goal: 1 call booked by Sunday
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
The DM script (feel free to steal):

"Hey [name] - saw your post about [pain point].

I'm building an AI cold email service for B2B SaaS ($500/mo vs the $2K+ tools).

Running first 5 campaigns for free to prove it works.

Interested in a 15min call?"

No pitch. Just value.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
What makes Caesar's Legions different:

Most cold email tools:
→ $2K-$5K/month
→ Generic templates
→ 2-week setup

Caesar's Legions:
→ $500/month
→ AI learns your voice
→ Live in 48 hours

Speed + personalization + price = market gap.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
Real talk:

I might fail at this.

But if I wait until "everything is perfect," I'll definitely fail.

Better to:
→ Ship messy
→ Learn fast
→ Iterate quickly

$0 → $10K MRR isn't about perfect code.
It's about solving real problems.
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Progress tracker (Day 2):

✅ Outreach strategy defined
✅ ICP validated
✅ DM scripts written
⏳ Finding first 20 prospects (in progress)
⏳ Manual campaign templates
📅 Tomorrow: Send outreach
📅 Sunday: Book first call

One question for B2B SaaS founders:

What's the BIGGEST reason your cold email doesn't work?

Reply with:
A - Wrong prospects
B - Bad copy
C - No follow-ups
D - Can't track what works

Most common answer gets a free audit.

(Genuinely want to know)

## Standalone Posts (Throughout the Day)

**Morning (9 AM):**
```
Building in public is terrifying.

Every mistake is visible.
Every pivot is questioned.
Every setback is public.

But it's also the fastest way to learn.

And learning fast > looking smart.

Day 2 of Caesar's Legions. Let's see what happens 🏛️
```

**Midday (1 PM):**
```
Lesson from Day 1:

Don't build infrastructure before you have customers.

I wasted 6 hours setting up the "perfect" backend.

Could've spent that time:
→ Talking to 10 prospects
→ Booking 2 calls
→ Closing 1 client

Tech is easy. Sales is hard.

Do the hard thing first.
```

**Afternoon (5 PM):**
```
Found 12 B2B SaaS founders posting about cold email struggles this week.

→ 8 complaining about low reply rates
→ 3 asking for tool recommendations
→ 1 just fired their SDR team

Tomorrow I DM all 12.

If even 2 respond, we're in business.

That's how you go $0 → $10K.
```

**Evening (8 PM):**
```
End of Day 2 status:

✅ 18 warm prospects identified
✅ Outreach scripts finalized
✅ Campaign templates drafted (manual for now)
✅ Payment link ready

Tomorrow: Send 20 DMs
Sunday: Book first call
Monday: Close first client

Or pivot if it doesn't work.

Either way, we learn.
```

## Engagement Strategy (Reply Targets)

Search these terms on X and reply helpfully (5-10 replies/day):

**Search queries:**
- "cold email not working"
- "outbound struggling"
- "low reply rate"
- "how to find B2B prospects"
- "best cold email tool"

**Reply template:**
```
I'm building something for exactly this (Caesar's Legions).

The issue is most tools are built for agencies, not founders.

DM me if you want to chat - happy to share what's working for us (no pitch, genuine help).
```
