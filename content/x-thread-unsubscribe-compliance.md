Built Caesar's Legions to $0 → $10K MRR.

Day 3: Just shipped global unsubscribe list.

Most cold email tools treat compliance as an afterthought.

Here's why that's stupid (and how we fixed it): 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
```
If you email someone who already unsubscribed from another campaign, you:

1. Waste money on that send
2. Risk spam reports
3. Look like an idiot who can't track basic data
4. Break CAN-SPAM (fines up to $51,744 PER EMAIL)

Yet most tools don't have cross-campaign unsubscribe lists.
```

**Tweet 3 (Why It Matters):**
```
Here's the math:

10 campaigns running simultaneously
Each hits 1,000 prospects
20% overlap between campaigns

= 200 people getting duplicate emails
= 200 chances to piss off the EXACT same person

One spam report tanks your entire domain.
```

**Tweet 4 (How Others Handle It):**
```
How most cold email tools handle this:

❌ "Just create separate lists for each campaign"
❌ "Manually check for duplicates"
❌ "Use a CRM to track unsubscribes"

Translation: Not our problem, figure it out yourself.

Meanwhile your sender reputation dies.
```

**Tweet 5 (Our Solution):**
```
Caesar's Legions: Global unsubscribe from day 1.

How it works:

1. Someone unsubscribes → Added to global list
2. New campaign uploads → Automatic cross-check
3. Matches removed → Never emailed again
4. Real-time API → Works across all campaigns

Zero manual work. Zero duplicate sends.
```

**Tweet 6 (The Code - Technical Credibility):**
```
Implementation (< 100 lines):

- SQLite table: email + timestamp + reason
- Background job: Check all new uploads against global list
- REST API: /api/unsubscribe/:email
- Webhook: Auto-sync with email provider

Ship time: 3 hours.
Cost: $0 (built into existing infra).
```

**Tweet 7 (Bonus Feature):**
```
But we went further.

Also tracks:

• Bounce rate per domain
• Spam complaints per campaign
• Hard bounces (never email again)
• Temporary bounces (retry later)

= Protect your sender reputation automatically
```

**Tweet 8 (The Insight):**
```
Why don't others do this?

Because they're selling VOLUME, not RESULTS.

More emails sent = more money for them
Your spam folder problem = not their problem

We get paid when you get REPLIES, not sends.

Incentives matter.
```

**Tweet 9 (Results/Social Proof - PLACEHOLDER):**
```
Early results (first 3 test campaigns):

Before: 15% bounce rate
After: 2.8% bounce rate

Before: 3 spam complaints
After: 0 spam complaints

Before: Landing in spam 60% of the time
After: Landing in inbox 92% of the time
```

**Tweet 10 (CTA):**
```
Building Caesar's Legions in public:

Goal: $0 → $10K MRR in 90 days
Current: Day 3, $0 MRR
Tech: AI-powered email generation + smart deliverability

## Alternative Hooks (Test These)

**Hook A (Provocative):**
```
Your cold email tool is helping you break the law.

And they don't care.

Here's why: 🧵
```

**Hook B (Empathy):**
```
Spent $500 on cold email last month.

All emails went to spam.

Turns out the tool had ZERO deliverability features built in.

Here's what they should have shipped from day 1: 🧵
```

**Hook C (Specific Number):**
```
One spam report can cost you $51,744.

Most cold email tools do NOTHING to prevent this.

We built 5 features that protect you automatically: 🧵
