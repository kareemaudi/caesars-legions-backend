## THREAD

### Tweet 1/8 (Hook)

48 hours ago, Caesar's Legions was just an idea.

Now it's live, taking payments, and we're ready for our first client.

Here's what we built (and what almost broke):

🧵👇

### Tweet 2/8 (The Problem)

Most cold email agencies charge $5-10K/month.

Their secret? Apollo + Instantly + GPT-4 + manual QA.

Cost to run: ~$200/month.

Margin: 2000-5000%.

We're building the same system. But charging $250/month.

---

### Tweet 3/8 (The Build)

Built in 2 days:
- ✅ Lead sourcing (Apollo API)
- ✅ Email generation (GPT-4o, hyper-personalized)
- ✅ SMTP sending (Zoho, 50/day to start)
- ✅ Follow-up automation (3-day, 7-day sequences)
- ✅ Client dashboard (real-time metrics)
- ✅ Stripe payments ($250/mo)

Total cost: $0 (all time, no money)

---

### Tweet 4/8 (The Almost-Disaster)

Almost launched with a fatal bug:

`gpt-4` → Doesn't exist anymore.  
Should be: `gpt-4o`

Would've crashed on first customer email.

Caught it 2 hours before launch.

Lesson: Test the full flow with real data. Every. Single. Time.

---

### Tweet 5/8 (The Economics)

Cost per client (monthly):
- Apollo: $9/mo (starter plan, amortized)
- OpenAI: ~$5-10 (100 emails @ $0.019/email)
- SMTP: $0 (Zoho free tier)
- Hosting: $5 (Railway)

**Total: ~$20/month**

Selling at: $250/month

Margin: ~92%

This is why agencies charge $10K.

### Tweet 6/8 (The Next 48 Hours)

Now live at: https://promptabusiness.com

Next steps:
1. Send 10 DMs to B2B SaaS founders (prospects already researched)
2. Run free beta campaign for first client
3. Get testimonial
4. Convert to paid

Goal: $250 MRR by Friday.

---

### Tweet 7/8 (What We Learned)

Building > Planning

We spent:
- 20% planning
- 80% building

Most founders do the opposite.

The system isn't perfect. It's *good enough to validate*.

Perfect is the enemy of launched.

---

### Tweet 8/8 (The Ask)

If you're a B2B SaaS founder struggling with cold email:

Reply "interested" and I'll send you our beta offer.

First 5 people: Free test campaign (50 emails).

Just want to see if this actually works in the wild.

Let's go 🏛️

## MEDIA ASSETS TO CREATE

1. **Screenshot of dashboard** (metrics, clean UI)
2. **Before/After email examples** (template spam vs our personalized)
3. **System architecture diagram** (Apollo → GPT-4 → SMTP)
4. **Pricing comparison table** (agencies vs us)

## HASHTAGS

## POSTING SCHEDULE

**Option A: Thread (all at once)**
- Post entire thread Monday morning (9 AM US Eastern)
- Higher engagement, better reach
- Risk: Longer to write, higher time investment

**Option B: Individual tweets (spread out)**
- 1 tweet every 2 hours today
- Keeps timeline active
- Risk: Less cohesive narrative

**Recommendation:** Option A (thread). More impactful.

---

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

After posting:
1. Reply to every comment within 1 hour
2. DM people who say "interested"
3. Quote tweet with additional insights
4. Monitor mentions
5. Cross-post to LinkedIn (professional network)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- **Impressions:** 1,000+ (realistic for small account)
- **Engagements:** 50+ (likes, retweets, replies)
- **DMs from founders:** 3-5
- **Actual leads:** 1-2

If we get 1 client from this thread → ROI = $250/month for 30 min of writing.
