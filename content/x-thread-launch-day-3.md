## Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
48 hours ago I started building an AI cold email agency.

Today I have:
• 10 qualified leads
• Fully working backend
• AI that writes better emails than most humans

Here's what I learned building in public 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**
Cold email is broken.

Most founders pay $200-500/mo for tools (Instantly, Lemlist, Clay)...

Then spend 20+ hours/week writing emails, finding leads, managing campaigns.

The tools don't solve the real problem: TIME.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Insight):**
I realized something:

AI agents can do 95% of the work.

• Research prospects (Apollo API)
• Write personalized emails (GPT-4)
• Handle follow-ups automatically
• Track everything

The only thing they can't do? Close the deal. That's still on you.

---

**Tweet 4 (The Build):**
So I built it:

Day 1: Backend infrastructure, email generator, Apollo integration
Day 2: Follow-up automation, prospect research system, SMTP setup
Day 3: Ready to onboard first client

Total cost to build: $0 (bootstrapped)

---

**Tweet 5 (How It Works):**
Here's the flow:

1. AI scrapes your ICP from LinkedIn/Apollo
2. AI researches each prospect (web, socials, recent activity)
3. AI writes unique email for each (not templates)
4. You approve batch (stay in control)
5. AI sends + handles follow-ups

Simple. Effective. Scalable.

---

**Tweet 6 (The Numbers):**
Current cold email benchmarks:
• 1-3% reply rate = average
• 5-7% = good
• 8%+ = exceptional

We're targeting 10%+ with deep AI personalization.

How? Every email references something REAL about the prospect.

No "I saw your company" BS.

---

**Tweet 7 (Pricing Philosophy):**
Most tools charge per seat or per email.

I'm charging for RESULTS:

$99/mo OR $500 for first campaign.

If you don't get 10+ qualified replies in Month 1, you don't pay for Month 2.

Skin in the game.

---

**Tweet 8 (What I'm Looking For):**
I need 3 beta clients to prove this works.

Ideal fit:
• B2B SaaS or service business
• Revenue: $10K-100K/mo
• Currently doing outbound (or want to start)
• Willing to share results publicly

DM if interested 👇

---

**Tweet 9 (Transparency):**
Will I fail? Maybe.

But I'm documenting everything:
• Every email sent
• Every reply received
• Every lesson learned
• Every dollar earned

Follow along if you want to see how to build in public (for real).

---

**Tweet 10 (Call to Action):**
If you're spending >$200/mo on cold email tools...

Or >10 hours/week writing emails...

You're doing it wrong.

Let AI do the grunt work. You close the deals.

DM "CAESAR" if you want to be a beta client.

Let's build this together. 🏛️

## Post-Thread Actions

After posting:
1. Monitor replies/DMs immediately
2. Reply to every comment within 30 min
3. Screenshot any positive engagement
4. Update `research/inbound-leads.json` with interested people
5. Follow up with warm leads within 24 hours

## Engagement Strategy

When people reply, use these angles:

**If skeptical:**
"Fair question. I'm offering first campaign for free to 3 beta clients. If it doesn't work, you lose nothing but time. If it does, you get a predictable lead gen system."

**If interested:**
"Amazing! Quick questions: (1) What's your ICP? (2) Currently doing any outbound? (3) What's your reply rate goal? DM me and we'll set up a quick call."

**If competitive (other founders building similar):**
"Let's chat! Always down to compare notes with other builders in the space. Maybe there's a collaboration opportunity."

**If curious about tech:**
"Built on: OpenAI GPT-4 (email gen), Apollo.io (lead sourcing), custom Node.js backend. Took 48 hours to MVP. Happy to share more if you're building something similar."
