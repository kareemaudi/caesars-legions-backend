# Outreach Templates for First Clients

## 🎯 Target Profiles
1. **Active Seekers** - Currently asking about cold email tools
2. **Successful Users** - Already doing cold email well, could scale with AI
3. **Service Providers** - Could white-label or partner

## Template 1: Reply to Active Seeker (@GigaaRoy)

**Context:** Asked "What cold email platform do you use? That's where I'm struggling"

**Reply:**
```
Most platforms overcomplicate it. Built Caesar's Legions specifically for this:

• AI writes personalized emails (not templates)
• Apollo.io enrichment built-in
• Deliverability managed automatically

Running it for 10 clients right now. 15-20% reply rates.

Want to see a sample campaign for your ICP? DM me and I'll generate one (free).
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges his struggle
- Specific results (15-20% reply rates)
- Free value offer (sample campaign)
- Not pushy, helpful

## Template 2: DM to Successful User (@theduragpapi)

**Context:** B2B SaaS founder making bank with cold email, shared screenshots

**DM:**
```
Saw your cold email numbers – impressive! $108K from 500 emails is elite.

Question: How much time does your 1.5 SDR spend on email writing vs. other parts of the funnel?

Built an AI that handles the full email workflow (research → personalization → sending). Wondering if it'd free up time for your team to focus on calls/demos.

Mind if I show you a quick example with your ICP?
```

**Why it works:**
- Compliments their success first
- Asks a pain point question (time spent)
- Positions as efficiency tool, not replacement
- Asks permission before pitching

## Template 3: Partnership DM (@ankit_saas)

**Context:** Cold email expert who got client to $15K deal

**DM:**
```
Respect the 34 demos in 25 days. That's serious execution.

Quick question: When you set up cold email for clients, how do you handle the personalization at scale?

I've built an AI system that writes 100% unique emails (not templates) based on Apollo data. Works great for SaaS founders.

Could be useful for your clients. Want to see how it works? Could potentially white-label it if you're interested.
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges his expertise
- Asks about his process (shows respect)
- Offers solution to specific pain point
- Opens door to partnership (white-label)

• Use AI to write unique emails (not templates that trigger spam filters)

Happy to share the full checklist if useful.
