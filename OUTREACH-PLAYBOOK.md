Hey [Name],

Saw your tweet about [cold email pain point]. 

I just built an AI cold email service (Caesar's Legions) and I'm looking for 3 beta clients to test it with.

$250/mo for 100 personalized emails/week + automated follow-ups. GPT-4 powered, Apollo sourcing, real-time dashboard.

Want to be one of the first 3? (You'll keep this price forever even when I raise it.)

### Template 2: Build in Public
```
[Name] - quick question:

I'm building an AI cold email service and documenting everything publicly. Looking for 3 early customers who want:

• 100 personalized emails/week
• AI-powered personalization (GPT-4)
• Automated 3-day & 7-day follow-ups
• $250/mo (locked in forever)

You get Day 1 access + pricing. I get feedback + a case study.

Worth a 15-min call?

**When to use:** They're a build-in-public founder (higher trust)

### Template 3: Direct ROI Pitch
```
[Name],

Your SaaS is at [$X MRR] (congrats!). 

I'm guessing outbound is either:
(a) Not happening
(b) Manual and slow
(c) Happening but not converting

I built an AI system that sends 100 personalized cold emails/week for you. $250/mo.

If it gets you 1 customer, it pays for itself. If not, cancel anytime.

Launch special: First 3 clients lock in this price forever.

Interested?
```

**When to use:** They post revenue updates (you know their scale)

---

### Template 4: Case Study Approach
```
Hey [Name],

Running a quick experiment: 

Can an AI agent (GPT-4) outperform human-written cold emails?

I need 3 B2B SaaS companies to test this with. You get:
• 100 personalized emails/week
• Automated follow-ups
• Dashboard to track everything
• $250/mo (vs $1K+ for VAs)

In exchange: I document results publicly (no company details unless you approve).

Game?
```

**When to use:** Founders interested in AI/experimentation
