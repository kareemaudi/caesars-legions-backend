The next, crickets.\n\nWe've been helping B2B service companies build a predictable pipeline through targeted cold email outreach — 100 personalized emails per week to your exact ICP.\n\nThe result? Clients typically book 5-10 qualified calls monthly, creating a steady stream of opportunities instead of waiting for the phone to ring.\n\nWorth a quick conversation to see if it fits {company}?\n\nCaesar\nFounder, Caesar's Legions",
